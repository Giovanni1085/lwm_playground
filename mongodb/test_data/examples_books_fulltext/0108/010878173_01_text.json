The First Edition of this Hand Book was published exactly ten years ago. The Second rapidly followed upon the First ; and the continual demand for the work has produced the Third. The Author is exceedingly glad of the opportunity afforded him in this, the Third Edition, of introducing a great many additions and alterations, rendered necessary by the manifold and marvellous changes which have taken place in India since 1844, or suggested by the obviousness of former unavoidable omissions. The acquisition of Scinde, the Punjaub, and of more territory in Burmah. has given occasion for considerable mention of places scarcely referred to in the former volume. The compression of matter by the use of a smaller and closer type, and the excision of superfluous, because now obsolete, views of social usages and society, has afforded the means of describing the territories subordinate to the Madras and Bombay Governments, the Eastern Islands, Ceylon, and Kashmir, \u2014 none of which were embraced in previous editions."], [14, "VI PREFACE. Nor are these the only new features included in the pre sent edition: since 1S44 the Government of India has undergone a material change ; commerce and civilization have marched onward ; population has augmented ; the armies have been increased, and their rules and regulations much altered ; railways and the electric telegraph have been established, and the Ganges Canal completed and opened. None of the subjects arising out of these nume rous changes have been disregarded. Appearing almost coevally with the operation of the Act which gives a new form and character to the Govern ment of India, it is hoped that the \" Hand Book,\" which records and reflects the progress of events, will continue to merit the reputation which it has enjoyed since the hour of its first appearance. In a work of this description, reference has necessarily been had to a great many publications which treat of India ; and although at least one half the volume is original, and the result of the author's own experience of India and Anglo-Indian society, he readily acknowledges his obligations to the pages of Miss Roberts' \" Scenes and Sketches in Hindostan,\" Bishop Heber's \" Journal,\" Mrs. Postans' \" Western India,\" the late Sir William M'Naghten's \"Mahomedan Law,\" the Topographical Reports of the Madras Medical Society, Milburn's \" Oriental Commerce,\" Thornton's \" Countries West of the Sutlej,\" the works of Orme, Mill, Wilson, Selkirk, and others."], [15, "ADVERTISEMENT. Several subjects of importance will be found treated fully at page 417 to 427, and in the Appendix. They could not be introduced in the body of the work, in suitable places, because they were only in progress of completion while the previous sheets passed through the press. These subjects are : \u2014 1. The Electric Telegraph in India. 2. The course \u2014 completed and intended \u2014 of the Railways. 3. The Ganges Canal. 4. The College of Civil Engineers, &c, at Roorkee. 5. The Rules and Regulations connected with admis sion to, and retirement from, the Services, Furloughs. Civil and Military Funds, &c. The reader is requested to cancel the two paragraphs at pages 80 and 81, beginning, \" The foregoing suggestions, _>:\\\" \u2014 because within the last month or two, the \"General .v Steam Navigation Company\" has ceased to send vessels round the Cape of Good Hope.

OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF BRITISH INDIA. The attempt to comprise within a few pages anything approaching to an accurate sketch of the main incidents which have distinguished the history of the British empire on the continent of Asia, would prove so perfectly futile, that the following rough outline is offered rather as an apology than a substitute for the record which should be preliminary to a picture of India as it is. By no process of condensation could the contents of the pyramids of volumes which have been written to portray the progress of our power, from the hour when the first factory was established in India, to that which placed the Punjaub, Pegu, and a portion of the Burmese empire at our feet, be reduced within the compass of a reasonable library, much less com prised in a brief chapter of a single volume. Our excuse must therefore be, in venturing upon even a very slight ibstr\u00e6t, that we wished to form, for the benefit of the stranger who may never have bestovced any attention upon India, a connecting link between the history of the country md its remarkable position at the present moment, The early history of the vast continent of India is veiled in obscurity. The wonderful subterranean remains of archi tecture which exist to this moment in the western parts of the country demonstrate that they must have been inhabited by a people not inferior to the Babylonians and the Cushjtes n antiquity, and a knowledge of the arts of pei\\ce ; hut we fi"], [26, "2 THE ORIENTAL TRADERS. obtain no information respecting the inhabitants, although the historians us ancient Egypt have endeavoured to connect them with the victories of Sesostris. All that we know sot certain is, that the Tyrians carried on a trade with India by means of the Red Sea, and that the Greeks, beginning with Alexander and ending with Antiochus, penetrated as far a\u00ab the upper part of the Ganges,* taking possession ol tracts of country upon either side of the Indus ; that the dominion of the Greeks was succeeded by that of the Scythian nomades, who invaded Bactria, and that these, in their turn, were driven out by tlie Tartars. Next came the Mahometans, under Mahmoud of Ghuzni, who, about the year 1000, carried into effect his father's project for the conquest of India, and, after a series of aggressive expeditions, established Mussul man authority from the west of the Ganges to the province of Guzerat. From this time until the middle of the eigh teenth century, the power of these invaders augmented, and the whole continent gradually fell under their yoke ; the government of the various provinces being vested ia na waubs, who exercised sovereign control, with a reservation of obedience or fealty to the supreme power of the Great Mogul, who reigned in absolute despotism at Delhi. But in all these conquests and political aggrandisements, no European power took the slightest share. The intercourse with Iu dia, from the time of the expulsion of the Greeks, was confined entirely to commercial operations. The Egyptians and the Romans followed the Tyrians, sending their argosies down the Red Sea to the coast of Malabar, and receiving, in ex change for their commodities, the rich stuffs, drugs, dyes, gold, silver, ivory, &c, which formed the staples of Western India. The conquest of Egypt by the Saracens threw tk; whole trade into the hands of the latter, who made great efforts to extend it by carrying their enterprise beyond the extreme point of the peninsula of India to the islands of the Eastern Archipelago, thence to Siam, and ultimately tQ China. But the Saracens held no intercourse with Europe. Closing the port of Alexandria against the Christian trader, they preferred transmitting their return cargoes to Constantinople, through Asiatic Turkey and the Bla_ck Sea. * Embassy of Megasthenes."], [27, "THE EUROPEAN TRADERS. 3 The city of the Sultan, consequently, soon became the great mart for East-India and China produce, and to it the eyes of the Venetian and Italian states were directed. Eor a long time, however, the antipathy which the Christians and Mahometans bore to each other formed a bar to com mercial intercourse of any kind ; at length, the cupidity of the califs overcame their religious hatred, and a traffic commenced, which, while it gratified the anxiety of the Europeans to possess the products and manufactures of the East, conferred wealth upon the mercantile followers of the Prophet. In this state the trade with India continued until the Crusades gave territorial possession and influence to the southern European powers, and converted the expeditions, which were originally of a holy character, into commercial and secular enterprises. Partly by means of conquest, and partly through negotiation, the whole of the East-India trade at last passed from the Saracens into the hands of the Italians, and the port of Alexandria, until then closed by Mahometan hatred, was reopened to the ships of the Me diterranean. Florence, Genoa, and Venice were the first to reap the fruits of the great monopoly ; but the latter, by deputing an ambassador to India, to open a communication with ports until then not known even by name to the Euro peans, obtained exclusive supplies and benefits, which soon gave them an immense preponderance over their neighbours. To these advantages were shortly to be added the diminu tion of the Genoese trade by the destruction of Constan tinople, where they had established themselves to the entire exclusion of the Greeks. Thus, at the close of the fifteenth century, Venice supplied nearly all Europe with the pro ducts of the East, and soon raised herself, by her wealth, to an eminence that excited the jealousy and hostility of sur rounding nations. Great efforts were made by several states \u2014 the Dutch, the Germans, and the Spaniards \u2014 to obtain a share in this vastly lucrative commerce ; but neither in trigue nor the most tempting offers made to the rulers of Egypt and of Syria could shake the stability of Venetian power. Events, however, occurred, perfectly independent of commercial rivalry, which struck at the root of the great monopoly, and almost entirely diverted Oriental commerce into new channels. Christopher Columbus had discovered B 2"], [28, "4 THE CArE ROUTE. America, and the Portuguese had found a way to India round the Cape of Good Hope.* In 1497, the king of Portugal deputed Vasco de Gama to India, to ascertain whence the riches of the Venetians were drawn, and to endeavour to open a trade with the same sources by the route available to the ships of Portugal. The mission was successful ; the key to vast wealth was now obtained, and the Portuguese lost no time in improving their opportunities. Fleet after fleet was fitted out ; every port in India was visited ; possession was forcibly taken of several places upon the Malabar coast, the islands lying between Madagascar and the Moluccas, and the island of Ormus, in the Persian Gulf ; and a papal grant was obtained, confirming the prior discovery of the Portuguese, and thereby checking for a time the rivalry of other Catholic nations. Prodigious efforts were made by the Venetians, supported by the Mameluke government of Egypt, and subsequently by the Sultan, to counteract the advantages obtained by the Portuguese, but all was in vain. While, on the one hand, the latter defended with great skill and bravery their acquisitions in India and the Gulf of Persia from their enemies in the Red Sea and the coasts, they, on the other, continued to pour into Europe the products of the Oriental world in quantities and at a price against which the Venetians could not possibly contend. For more than a century the trade remained in the hands of the Portuguese. But the high road which * It is worthy of remark, that almost all the European authors assign exclusively to the Portuguese the credit of having been the first nation which doubled the Cape ; but according to Herodotus, Neco II., one of the Pharaohs, who lived twenty-one centuries before the era of Portuguese enterprise, caused a fleet of triremes to be fitted out, which, steering down the Red Sea, passed into the Southern Ocean, and, rounding the Cape, came up the west coast of Africa, returning to Egypt; through the Straits of Gibraltar. Pliny likewise records that Hanno, a Carthaginian, circumnavigated the continent of Africa, from Gades (the modern Cadiz) to the extremity of the Arabian Gulf, and wrote all the details of the voyage in the Punic language, when Carthage was at the height of her prosperity. The principal fact relied upon as establishing the truth of the Egyptian and Carthaginian navigators is, that they severally represent the sun as rising upon their right hand when they faced the north, as they sailed alone the coast of the African continent, \u2014 a circumstance which could not have happened unless they had doubled the Cape."], [29, "5 THE BRITISH TRADERS. they had discovered was open to all the world beside, and it was not to be supposed that they would retain exclusive right of way longer than it might suit the convenience of other nations to yield them the privilege. Accordingly, we find that as the maritime power of Holland increased, and her domestic cares diminished, the Dutch found it worth their while to turn their eyes to India. The example of Holland was speeuily followed by England, who, under the reign of Elizabeth, obtained leisure from foreign quarrels and religious discord, for commercial schemes of magnitude. From the hour of the arrival of these Protestant powers, the Portuguese date the downfal of their influence in India. Through the combined efforts of religious zeal and the con scious possession of superior physical force, they had been guilty of great oppression wherever they had planted the nationalflag, and had consequently raised up enemies amongst the natives, who were only too glad to afford support to any other Europeans whose interest came in collision with those of the Portuguese. Contests soon ensued between the new visitors and the old settlers, and the result was the expul sion of the latter from nearly all their positions, and the perfect annihilation of their commercial relations with the East. The English, obtaining from their own sovereign a charter* permitting them to trade to the East Indies, and securing to them a monopoly of the advantages of such commerce, directed their attention in India to the establishment of factories, under the protection, and with the consent, of the different potentates then ruling over her shores. On the Coromandel and Malabar coasts, and on the banks of the Hooghly, they planted their feet as humble traders. Bombay, which had been acquired by the Portuguese, was soon after ceded to the English, as part of the dowry of the Infanta, who became the consort of our Charles II. ; and very shortly afterwards the chartered merchants commenced a trade with China, whose tea was acquiring a certain degree of popularity in Great Britain. The success of one company of merchants suggested the formation of another, to whom the British government, in its distress for money, likewise * A.D. 1602."], [30, "6 THE FIRST WAR. granted a charter; but as this led to disputes abroad, and materially affected the interests of the new trade, a union of the two contending companies was effected in 1702. The prosperity of Holland and of England naturally exciting the jealousy of France, an East-India company wag formed by the French, who sent out ships, and soon obtained permission to establish agencies in Pondicherry and Ch. nd .r- nagore. These three nations, with the Danes and the Spaniards, who had also acquired small possessions, now constituted the European trading community in India, and through their enterprise and rivalry, the whole of the Western world was supplied with everything that the rich soil of the East, and the ingenuity and industry of her in- habitants, could produce. Some little molestation t< trade was occasionally offered by the barbarous and covetous princes in whose territories they were located, and bodies of soldiers were therefore allowed to be maintained by the home government to protect the factories, around which defences were erected. But it was not until the year 1745 that the corner-stone was laid of those occur- rences which converted the humble traders, content to de- fend their property from outrage, and to follow their com- mercial pursuits in peace and security, into warriors and politicians, and finally rendered them masters of the entire empire of India. In the year 1746, the Nabob of Arcot having died, the succession of his son to the musnud was disputed by a cousin named Mirzafa Jung. This pretender, mistrusting his own strength, applied to Dupleix, who com- manded the French troops in India, for assistance, which was promptly afforded, under the hope and expectation of reaping certain advantages from the connection, should the aid solicited prove effective. The legitimate heir to the musnud, and the Nabob of the Carnatic, Anaverdy Khan, on the other hand, sought the support of Major Laurence, who was in command of the British soldiery in the Camatic, and Major Laurence did not turn a deaf ear to the appeal. Hence arose a collision, which, with only occasional intervals of peace, has continued for nearly a century, until power after power has succumbed to the British arms, and what was gained by defensive warfare has been maintained by treaty, and consolidated by good government.

The government at home, to aid the merchants in their contest, sent out reinforcements of troops and ships. The French authorities in a similar manner recruited their forces abroad, and it was not until ten years had elapsed from the date of the first outbreak, that the latter sustained a com plete and decisive defeat. This took place at Plassy, in Bengal. Dupleix, the French chief, had acquired immense power through his espousal of the cause of Mirzafa Jung, and now aimed at the establishment of universal dominion in India. But Clive, a young captain, who had succeeded Laurence (now returned to England) in the command of the forces, attacked and took Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, defended it afterwards against an immense force, and esta blished for himself a high military reputation, which he subsequently augmented by a series of successful operations. Large tracts of country in the south were gradually ceded to the English, dive was made governor of Fort St. David's. Events however called him to Calcutta. A frightful mas sacre of Englishmen, merchants and factors, had taken place in that town. Surajah Dowlah, the vieeroy of Bengal, who hated the English, and who coveted the wealth their in dustry and enterprise had enabled them to accumulate, sought a quarrel with them, aud laying siege to their fort and fac tories, seized upon and shut them up in a small apartment, and 123 out of 146 were suffocated. Such cruelty called aloud for vengeance. Clive headed a force against the Nabob ; it was small, but compact and disciplined, \u2014 the thirty-ninth regiment (primus in Indis) formed a part of the gallant band \u2014 and pursuing the Nabob to the vicinity of Moorshed abad, gave him battle, and defeated an army of 40,000, on the plains of Plassy. From this hour (1757) the establish ment of the British empire in India may be dated. But new and permanent enemies had arisen while Clive and his successors laboured in Bengal. The great chieftains who divided the sovereignty of the Deccan, the Carnatic, in short the whole peninsula of India not occupied by the British, beheld with digmay the growth of the new European power, and formed alliances for its destruction. Hyder Ali,"], [32, "8 HYDER ALI AND TIPPOO SAIB. a political. adventurer and soldier of fortune, undertook the lead in these measures, and proved a formidable antagonist. He wrested several of their possessions from the English, wasted much of their territory with fire and sword, threat- ened Madras, and, compelling a large British force to lay down its arms, massacred nearly every man. For thirteen years were the whole resources of the British applied to re- sist this warrior, who, aided by the French, between whom and tho British a war had arisen in Europe, vigorously pro- secuted his operations, now gaining certain advam.. anon suffering severe defeats. Hyder Ali died in 1782, but his .on, Tippoo Saib, continued to wage war with the English, and they likewise found abundant employment in a contest wliich had arisen with the Mahrattas, on whom, for certain considerations, it was deemed expedient to attempt to force a rajah that they had expelled. It would be vain to attempt to follow the course of history through the multitudinous wars which were dovetailed into each other from the hour when Lord Cornwallis, in 1792, deprived Tippoo Saib of half his territory. Scarcely was the sword sheathed in one quarter, than it was drawn from the scabbard to chastise a new enemy in another direction. Sir John Shore (afterwards Lord Teign- mouth), who succeeded Lord Cornwallis as Governor-General of India, was engaged in a war with the Rohillas. The Marquis Wellesley, in 1798, found Tippoo Saib actively employed in new intrigues against the British, while the confederated Mahratta chiefs directed their hostility to our power in the west and north of India. Aided by his bro- ther the great Duke of Wellington, and General Lord Lake, the marquis applied his energies and the resources at his command to the destruction of these formidable opponents, and although their operations were guided and directed by able officers, engineers, and artillerists, he entirely destroyed the power annexed his dominions to those of the East-India Company, broke the Mahratta confederacy, and added 33,000 square miles to the British possessions The Marquis Wellesley was succeeded in his gora* ment by Sir George Barlow and Lord Minto, whose rule was more distinguished by domestic dissensions, intrigues, and the settlement of the provinces acquired, than by camn'aijms against external foes. The Marquis of Hastings assumed"], [33, "THE INDIAN ARMY ORGANIZED. 9 the reins of government in 1813, and during his adminis tration found it necessary to take the field against the Pindarries, the kingdom of Nepaul, and a host of Mahratta chieftains, whose restless spirit had induced them to violate the engagements they had entered into, and to endeavour to re-establish themselves in independent authority. After a long campaign, the Pindarries were exterminated, an advan tageous peace was made with the Nepaulese, and many states, hitherto independent, were compelled to become tributary to the Company. The effect of the policy of the Marquis of Hastings was to spread peace throughout India, and the attention of the government was now turned to the means of consolidating the vast empire which had been won by the sword. The army which had proved strong enough for con quest in detail, was not of sufficient extent to preserve the territory intact and suppress fresh attempts at insurrection. It was therefore largely augmented (in 1824), and as the close of the long war which had devastated Europe for a quarter of a century now placed many experienced soldiers at the disposal of the government for employment in the colonies and elsewhere, advantage was taken of the circumstance to put the troops in India under the command of some of those generals who had most distinguished them selves in the field against Napoleon and his generals. The result of this arrangement was soon obvious in the con version of a somewhat irregular, but brave and devoted force, into a large, well-organized, and admirably disciplined army, capable of bearing a comparison with the most effective troops on the continent of Europe. Scarcely, however, had the country rested from the turbulence of war, and the troops been dispersed over the empire to occupy posts which best protected the people in their peaceful pursuits, and held in check the quarrelsome disposition of neighbours, when the trumpet again sonnd^Lthe alarm. In 1820 an expedition was despatched _8^he Persian Gulf, under Sir W. Keir Grant, to put down the pirates who infested its shores. In 1821, another force, under Sir Lionel Smith, proceeded thither to avenge the trea chery under wliich a garrison belonging to the first had been put to the sword. In 1824, the Burmese obliged the government of Lord Amherst to despatch an armament"], [34, "10 THE WAR IN AFFGHANISTAN. against them, to punish their invasion of British territory ; whence ensued a contest which lasted for two years, I nating in the surrender by the Burmese of 50,000 square miles of territory, and their agreement to pay ten crores of rupees towards the expenses of the campaign. In Lord Combermere, then commander-in-chief in India, reduced the fortress of Bhurtpore, and took prisoner its intriguing sor, whose machinations threatened to disturb the peace of Upper India. From this time, and for twelve years subsequently, the operations of the military were confined to petty warfare in the country of the Coles (Bengal), iu the rajahship of Coorg, in Raj pootana, and the unsettled districts in the south of India ; but in 1838, events arose which gave employment to nearly every soldier in the service, and led to a campaign attended with disasters to which a -British army had hitherto been strangers. The designs of Russia upon the English possessions in India had for a long time been a subject of suspicion and of discussion. Excepting, however, in the instance of her advances upon the Persian frontier, nothing had occurred to awaken particular alarm, or render any measures, beyond those of the commonest pre caution, at all necessary. But in 1837 it became apparent that her emissaries and agents were at work in Affghanistan, to foment and keep alive disputes between the Ameer ruling in Cabul and the government of the Punjaub, with which we were on terms of amity ; and there was good reason to suppose that if we did not interfere to check the progress of the quarrel, the Affghans would approach, by force of conquest, near enough to India to precipitate a dangerous collision between the British and the power that was suspected of instigating them to aggression. Overtures of friendship were consequently made to the Ameer of Cabul, Dost Mahomed ; but failing of effect, it was resolved to send an army to dethrone him, and to place on the musnud, in his room, an exiled sovereign (Shah Soojah), who would be more favourable to our views, and in whose kingdom we might be permitted to retain a force that should at once protect him in his seat and oppose a barrier to advances from the north. Accordingly, an army of 15,000 men, under Sir John Keane, was despatched, during the govern ment of Lord Auckland, to place Shah Soojah upon the"], [35, "11 THE WAR WITH CHINA. throne, and to enter into alliance or friendly arrangements with the people occupying the large tracts of country lying between India and Affghanistan. Sir John Keane went, saw, and conquered, and returned to England to enjoy, in a peerage and a pension, the reward of his easy victory. Shah Soojah maintained his sovereignty for three years, with the continual help of British bayonets ; but at the end of that time, the chieftains, whose power had terminated with his restoration, combined to dethrone him and expel his allies ; a measure which they were enabled to effect, partly through the division of counsels in the British camp, and partly through the extreme severity of the season. Our troops were driven to capitulate, and marching out of Affghanistan in the depth of winter, destitute of supplies and ammunition, were assailed in the mountains and massacred almost to a man. This sad blow to our arms was avenged a year after wards by a fresh body of troops under Generals Pollock and Nott, acting under the directions of Lord Ellenborough, who had now become Governor-General of India ; but the original purposes of the first expedition having been frus trated, and further interference in the affairs of Afghanistan offering no compensation, either in present or prospective security, for the great expense of occupation, the country was desolated and then abandoned. While these events were taking place to the north-west of India, occupation was found for a considerable proportion of the army in China. The Chinese government had insulted a British envoy, imprisoned British subjects, and sequestrated and destroyed British property. To chastise these outrages, obtain indemnification for the pecuniary injury, and security for future commercial dealings, expeditions were fitted out, and after a contest of two or three years' duration, a peace was obtained, under circumstances as honourable to the arms of Great Britain as it has proved fruitful of advantage to her trade. Here, it was supposed, strife and bloodshed had reached a termination, and in the confidence of this belief the Governor- General proclaimed perpetual peace in Asia, declaring his purpose of abstaining from all intervention in foreign affairs. Hardly, however, had the pacific declaration been published in every corner of the empire, when it was found necessary"], [36, "12 THE GOVERNMENT OF GWALIOR. to punish the Scindians for alleged treacherous cons j against a part of the force retiring from Southern AffghanK tan, and for certain overt acts of hostility subsequent to our evacuation of that country. The ameers of Scinde refused the satisfaction demanded at their hands, took arms, attacked the British residency at Hydrabad while negotiations wtM yet on foot, gave battle to the small army under Sir Charles Napier, which had been employed to sustain the demand for reparation, were defeated, and their territory became a part of the British empire ! Subsequently, towards the close of the year 1843, the British government found it necessary to interfere with the state of Gwalior to enforce the fulfilment of that portion of the treaty wliich regulated the succession to the musnud. The death of the Maharajah, and the serious disruption wliich resulted therefrom, rendered this state the scene of hostilities, and caused a complete alteration in the govern- ment. The Baee, the widow of the late prince, herself a girl of thirteen, belonging to a family of historical distinc- tion in Mahratta annals, had adopted a boy of eight as her son. An application was made, as usual, to the British government, as standing in the position of the emperors, and enjoying the paramount authority in Iudia, for the confirmation of this choice. Lord Ellenboroudi gave his sanction both to the adoption and to the appoint- ment of the Mama Saib as vizier. Soon after, the Dada Khasgee obtained the confidence of the young Baee, by a seraglio intrigue, and ignominiously expelled the minister of our approval, and placed the country in a hostile attitude towards the British government. Remonstrances were offered, but to no purpose. Our government was set at open defiance in the face of India, and we had but two alternatives before us : that of vindicating our authority by whatever means the obstinacy of the durbar might render necessary, or of relinquishing our paramount influence from the mountains to the sea. An army of exercise was assem- bled on the Gwalior frontier, to give weight to the represen- tations of our minister ; but his efforts to restore pacific relations entirely felled. The Gwalior army of 20 000 dLsciphned troops, with 200 pieces of ordnance, animated with the recollection of former triumphs, had meanwhile"], [37, "BATTLE OF MAHARAJPORE. 13 become unmanageable by the durbar. Our own neighbour ing province of Bundlekund had been for nearly two years in an unsettled state, and the anarchy at Gwalior had tended to keep up the spirit of insurrection. It was impossible for our government, responsible as it was for the security of its own subjects and the peace of India, to remain quiescent, with a hostile durbar and a mutinous army within 100 miles of its northern capital. As the season for military operations ap proached, the remonstrances of the Governor-General became more urgent, but the only effect they produced was to restore harmony between the Gwalior court and army. The Governor- General proceeded to Agra, and ministers were sent from Gwalior to meet him ; but there was so evident a manifestation of the usual Mahratta perfidy in all their negotiations, that our army was ordered to take the field and march towards the capital. There is every reason to believe, by a comparison of dates, that the messengers who were despatched to the Lahore durbar to urge an inroad into our territories, were sent at the same time that the envoys set out for Agra to meet Lord Ellenborough with their hollow promises. As the army advanced, the Mahratta negotiators were instructed to assure Lord Ellenborough of the entire sub mission of the Baee and her councillors, and his lordship was induced to halt three entire days, in daily expectation of her coming into the camp, together with the young prince. But far different were the designs of the court. The time thus gained was devoted to the most active preparations for resist ance. The young Baee appeared like an Amazon, super intending the despatch of troops, punishing the lukewarm, and animating her followers by every consideration of honour and profit to resist to the death. The Governor-General's eyes were at length opened by shots fired on Colonel Sleeman, who had called at Gwalior on his way from Bundlekund to the camp ; and our troops advanced to the city. Soon afterwards they came unexpectedly on the batteries which had been erected during the night, at Maharajpore, unknown to us ; and a bloody engagement ensued. It was perhaps the first time in which our troops were nearly matched in number by those of the enemy, and this was also one of the best-contested battles the natives have ever fought with us. The bodies of the enemy lay in heaps around their guns, and"], [38, "1. NEW TREATY WITH GWALIOR. nothing but British valour carried the day. Another battle was about the same time fought at Punniar. We were vic- torious in both instances. The kingdom of Gwalior *wai prostrate at our feet ; but we contented ourselves -with a new treaty (for the appropriation of territory was at the moment au unpopular subject with the Home government) of which the following is an analysis. Article 1 recapitulates and confirms old and superannuated treaties, except so far* as they may be altered by the present engagement. Art. _ states that the durbar engages to appropriate the revenues of sixteen districts, to the extent of 1,300,700 rupees for the support of the British subsidiary force. Art. 3 provides, that if the revenues of these districts exceed eighteen lacs of rupees, the surplus shall be paid over to his highness : if it fall short, the deficiency shall be made good by him. Art. _ provides that the civil administration of these districts shall be conducted by British officers. Art. 5 declares the suma due by the state of Gwalior to the British government, and provides for their payment. Art. 6 provides that the army of his highness shall be reduced to 9,000 men, thirty-two guns, and 200 gunners, and that immediate steps shall be taken to disband the rest of the troops. Art. 7 orders that his highness shall make good to the disbanded troops a gratuity of three months' pay. Art. 8 provides that the Maharajah's minority shall cease with his eighteenth year, and that the persons intrusted with the administration during his nonage shall act on the advice of the British resident on all matters whereon advice shall be offered, and that no change shall be made in the cabinet council without the consent of the British resident. Art. 9 enumerates the members of the cabinet council. Art. 10 provides that lara Baee, the Maharajah's mother, shall receive three lacs of rupees a year for her maintenance. Art. 1 1 pledges the British government, as heretofore, to exert its influence and good offices to maintain the just territorial rights of the Maharajah and his subjects existing in the neighbouring or other states ; and Art. 12 gives the ratification of the trekty bythe respective plenipotentiaries. Such is the nature of tlie treaty concluded with Gwalior. In the year 1845, Runjeet Sing, the founder of the Sikh empire m the Punjaub, having died, and his immediate su*"], [39, "15 WARS WITH THE SEIKHS AND BURMESE. cessors having met with violent deaths, the military force of the Punjaub became greatly disorganized. Their pay being much in arrear, and their chiefs incapable of control line them \u2014 the sovereign an infant, and the queen mother re \u00b0ent, an unscrupulous and intriguing woman, \u2014 the Seikha now clamoured to be led across the river Sutledge, that they might have an opportunity of plundering the British pos sessions. Every effort was made to restrain so mad, auda cious, and unjustifiable a step, but without avail. They assembled in great force and invaded the Cis-Sutledge pro vinces. Sir H. Hardinge, the then Governor-General, ad vanced with a small force, commanded by Sir Hugh Gough, to repel the incursion. Three severe battles were fought, in each of which the Seikhs were defeated ; but it was impos sible to drive them across the Sutledge without a reinforce ment of troops. These were sent for. Previous to their arrival, the Seikhs had strongly intrenched themselves on the left bank of the Sutledge, near the village of Sobraon. Reinforced, the British attacked and penetrated the line, drove the Seikhs into and over the Sutledge, and pur- sued them to Lahore, where they submitted. A government, was now established at Lahore under British surveillance, but the helplessness ofthe king, a minor, left the country at the mercy of the sirdars or chiefs, one of whom caused the murder of British officers at Mooltan, while others revived hostilities, and assumed a menacing posture. New opera- tions now became necessary; Lord Gough for then Sir Hu\u00abh had been raised to the peerage\u2014 advanced with a considerable army against the Seikhs\u2014 defeated them signally at Goozerat, dispersed and disarmed them\u2014 and tne Puniaub was by the new Governor-General, the Earl ot Dalhousie, at once annexed to the British dominions. In. 1852, the Burmese governors of Rangoon oppressed British subjects. Redress was sought by every pacific and legitimate means, but without avail. An army and a fleet were there- fore equipped for Burmah, and after a prolonged campaign a large portion of the territories of the king of Ava was con- fiscated, and added to the British territory. Not including such possessions as may result from the last mentioned contest, the total area of \"British India which comprehends also Scinde, the Punjaub, the Jullunder Doab,"], [40, "16 GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. and Tenasserim, is estimated at 800,758 square miles. To this may be added the native states tributary to or pn>. tected by tbe British government, which are computed at 508,442 square miles ; making a grand area of one million and one-third square miles. In the foregoing sketch, we have confined ourselves en- tirely to a rough and hasty narrative of the progress of con- quest. The outline of history, rude as it is, would, however- be still more imperfect were all mention to be omitted of the various measures which had gradually been inti \u2022\u25a0 to render the tenure of the couutry firm, and to confei the people a better description of civil government than that which had been displaced. In 1784, a bill was passed by the parliament of Great Britain, placing the government of India under a Board of Control, composed of the king's ministers. This measure, while it in some degree affected the patronage of the Company, afforded a guarantee of pm tection to the people, and strengthened the hands of t h.. local authorities in their quarrels with the French and the native powers. Between 1760 and 1773, charters were granted, establishing commissions for the tiial of pirates at all the presidencies ; and in 1774, a Supreme Court of iu* catare was established in Bengal, with powers co-ext.*,,, ive with the courts in England Courts of justice were likewise erected at Bombay and Madias, and by 1837, each presidency, and the settlement of Penang, had its Supreme Court. In 181-5, the trade to India was partially opened to the public under certain restrictions ; and in 1833, the trading mono poly ot the East-India Company was entirely abolished * the country thrown open to European adventurers of all classe* \u2022 places of trust made accessible to the natives and people of aU denominations; the ecclesiastical establishment ana- mented and the number of members of the Supreme Council increased The press in India has since then been freed : education is spreading its effects over the country : t. glorious principle of religious liberty is recognised : \u2022profes sional assassmation, infanticide, and human have dXe1\u00b0^l ' laWl? and PredatM7 tribes have been mS1^lPi;.I75.1^abr0gated,; a canal, 800 miles ,n length has been nearly completed ; railroads have been commenced at the three presidencies . an electric 5"], [41, ""], [42, ""], [43, "19 CLIMATE OF INDIA. ra'ph has been laid down ; and native empiricism has been uperseded by European science taught at medical colleges.

CLI M ATE. PRODUCTIONS. Over so extensive a tract of country as that comprised witliin the limits of British India, it is not to be supposed that the climate is uniform in its temperature, or that the seasons change everywhere at the same period. The preva lence of particular winds, the existence of chains of moun tains, the alternations of forests and tracts of land where vegetation is comparatively scanty, exercise material influ ence in India, as elsewhere ; while the difference of latitude is not, of course, without its ordinary effects in yielding various degrees of heat and cold. The sun burns with equal intensity in the north and the south, but the soil and the wind determine the quality of its action. The north of Hindostan is cold, mountainous, sandy, and barren ; the south is hot, level, moist, and fertile. Nevertheless, the extreme points of the country have their varieties of season \u2014periods when the bracing hyperborean atmosphere tempers the meridional regions, and the Himalayas change their coating of snow for a rich and verdant garment. In Bengal, for example, during the months of November, December, January, and Februarv, the days are clear and fine ; the air pure and elastic ; the north wind bracing ; the nights are foggy but not a drop of rain, excepting, perhaps, a partial shower at Christmas, falls during the four months. At such a season the European constitution, harassed and broken by a long continuance of moist and oppressive weather, becomes invigorated ; the appetite and strength, which had pre, c"], [44, "20 PRODUCTIONS OF INDIA. swamps, or composed entirely of sandy and sterile land unavoidably left waste, and the residue scarcely suffices to support the assertion that India is moderately wealthy, much less that she is generous and abundant. The great staple 0 the lower and southerly parts of India is rice, which \u2022 tutcs the food of a vast majority of the population. \u2022 In il \u25a0, upper country, wheat is the principal article of prod the same useful end. Barley, gram, and other pulgi likewise grown in large quantities, and are consumed indif ferently by man and the beasts of the field. Fol1 these in importance are the cotton and the mulbern the indigo and tobacco plants ; the sugar-cane and the cocoa-tree ; for their produce is convertible to purposes of commerce, and composes the true riches of the country. The poppy is largely cultivated in the province of Behar, and in Central India, whence is manufactured the opium of which the East-India Company preserve a monopoly, as they do also of the immense quantities of salt manulai for common consumption. Of the fruits and veg' grown in India, the principal are the mango, the pine-apple, the plantain, pomegranates, lemons, oranges, puinpl, grapes, tamarinds, plums, figs, almonds, guavas, loquats, leechees, custard-apples, citrons, melons, jacks, soui potatoes, cabbages, cucumbers, yams, brinjalls ; a great variety of vegetables, compounded of the cucumber and the melon tribes ; and where climate assists the labours of the agricultural and horticultural societies, all the prod' the kitchen-gardens of Europe. The Flora of India is gay but scentless ; the flowers opening at dawn of day are robbed by the sun of their fragrance at the moment that he drinks the dew-drops which bespangle them. In the forests we find the teak-tree, the mighty banian, whose branches spread over acres, yielding a grateful shade to the traveller, and a rendezvous for the wild denizens of the woods ; the bamboo, the saul, the palm, and a vast affluence of timber, convertible to building purposes, fuel, and th\u00bb construction of boats, all connected, covered, choked, by masses of vegetation, in the form of high grasses, gigantic shrubs, and luxuriant creepers. These, and a countless variety of roots, herbs, and small trees, bearing spices and drugs, constitute the sum ofthe Indian vegetable kingdom,"], [45, "THE ANIMALS OF INDIA. 21 The animal creation partakes of the exuberance of the sister world. Of tame and domestic beasts, India possesses the elephant, the camel, the horse, the ox, the ass, the mule, the dog, the cat, the goat, the sheep, the hog, the buffalo, the ichneumon, the rabbit \u2014 all, however, inferior in size to the animals of Europe, consecrated to the service of man. Of wild beasts, the jungle produce an immense number, and of different species. The principal are the tiger, lion, leo- pard, panther, rhinoceros, boar, bison, deer, wolves, jackals, bears, foxes, wild cats, hyenas, &c. Reptiles are likewise extremely numerous, from the enormons boa-constrictor, which makes a single meal of a heifer, to the scorpion and the centipede, which infest alike the houses of the rich and poor, in populous town or in wretched hamlet. The rivers of India, and the seas which wash her shores, abound with fish, which afford cheap and nutritive food to her millions. The delicious pomphret, the delicate bummelow, the seer aud rock fish, the prawn and the sole, are found upon the coasts ; the hilsa, the bekhtee, the mullet, the whiting, the delicate mango-fish, the oyster, the lobster, craw-fish, and shoals of the most minute members of the piscatorial cre- ation, swarm in the great rivers. But they are not without other enemies than man. The alligator and the porpoise assist the gull and the stork to destroy countless myriads ; the former animal, which often grows to the length of fifteen feet, occasionally visiting the banks of rivers likewise, to bear off a stray cow, a human being incautiously bathing near his haunts, or any smaller living object that offers meat for his capacious maw. The feathered part of the creation is of corresponding magnitude, in point of numbers and diversity, with the rest of the wonderful offspring of Nature's hand ; from the eagle, exercising sovereign sway in the mountains of the north, to the, solemn and stately hargillah (adjutant), which aids the vulture to perform the useful office of scavenger in the south. The ornithological inha- bitants of Hindostan comprise almost every known variety : to name them all would be an impossibility, within the pre- scribed limits of this section, comprehending as they do the domestic fowls of Europe, the birds of prey common to all climates, a prodigious number of game-birds, and innumer able tenants of the grove, whose plumage is as unrivalled"], [46, "22 POPULATION OF INDIA. for its splendour as their song is unparalleled by the sweetert notes of the warblers of the West.

POPULATION. MA1TNERS A_ND CUSTOMS. The estimated population of India is 152,000,000. however, is a very rough computation, for no census ha been taken of the inhabitants, nor, if a judgment may h formed from the extreme difficulty of ascertaining th' her of residents in towns which have for the longest period formed part of the British possessions, could a fair cen any possibility be prepared. The estimate is probably offered as the aggregate of returns from the local officers of the different districts, who have hazarded a guess founded npoa the rough calculations of their native subordinates. The natives of India may be divided into two classes \u2014 the Hindoos and the Mussulmans ; the former of whom are the pure and legitimate descendants of the aborigines, arid the latter the offspring of the successive generations of Maho- metan conquerors. In addition to these great classes, of which the Hindoos are in the proportion of four to one of the Mussulmans, there are many tribes who have estabhshed themselves in India originally as traders, or who have found shelter from foreign persecution, and are now become and parcel of the gross population. Such are the Parsees, descendants of the ancient Guebres, or fire-worshippers ; the Armenians, formerly refugees from Persian persecution ; the Arabs, Jews, Persians, chiefly traders from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf ; the Portuguese, coloured descendants of tlie early conquerors ; the Eurasians, or East-Indians, offspring of English, Dutch, French, and Danish connection with Hin doo, Mussulman, or Portuguese females; the Chinese, settlers"], [47, "23 CASTE AND RELIGION. from the Celestial empire ; Burmese, chiefly employed in menial pursuits ; Seikhs and Affghans, merchants from the neighbouring states ; the English, soldiers, civil officers, merchants, agriculturists, lawyers, seamen, ecclesiastics, &c. ; French, merchants and agriculturists ; a few Americans, and others from the Western world. The Hindoos are separated into four great castes, ok re- ligious divisions \u2014 Brahmins, Katries or Rajpoots, Bhyses, and Soudras. Of these, the former occupy the highest place in the esteem of their countrymen. To them are intrusted the performance of religious ceremonies and the instruction of the people, and they alone are permitted to read the Ve- das, or sacred books. Extraordinary privileges are accorded to them ; and when they are detected in crime, a milder punishment is inflicted than would fall to the lot of any other caste. The Katries are of royal and military descent. Bhyses, or Banians, are the trading class, and the Soudras comprehend the labourers and artificers. These four castes are subdivided into an infinite number of smaller tribes or sects, differing in some degree from the highest and mostortho- dox in matters of rehgion and in domestic usage ; while a fifth great class, called Pariahs, or Chandalas, comprehends all who have violated some leading principle in the rehgion of the other four, and have been banished the society of the faithful ; and all who follow the lowest professions in the scale of Indian society. The religion of the Hindoos, which indicates these distinctions and regulates the actions of their hves, is contained iu certain books, called the Vedas, or Shas- ters, written in the Sanscrit language. It is pretended that these volumes are the work of an inferior deity, named Brimha, descended from Bramha, the supreme god. They inculcate certain moral precepts, but are more precise in de- scribing the forms and ceremonies, the charities and regimen, of the Hindoo, and constitute, iu fact, the foundation of a system of idolatry and superstition, transcending in extra- vagance the worship of the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians.

If the former pi* position were admitted, the Enghsh would have slight cause for self-gratulation ; for, considered in the gross, there is not perhaps a people in the world who are so little distinguished by the virtues which adorn the human race as the inhabit ants of Hindostan. They are not insensible to tbe natural affections, nor are the examples they present of patience and resignation under calamity, and charity in the bestowal of alms, by any means rare ; but the per contra exhibits a sel fishness, a sensuality, a cowardice, a degree of avarice, cun ning, falsehood, malevolence, prejudice, inertness, and a host of minor vices, with which it is needless to swell our cata logue ; still, there are brilliant instances of exceptions to the ordinary rule.

The temperance and frugality suggested by inclination are counterbalanced by inordinate extravagance in the performance of ceremonials. The accumulation of years is often dissipated in a single week, to swell the pomp of a marriage procession, to honour the memory of a parent, or to propitiate some one of the imaginary deities with whom is supposed to rest the means of vengeance or the power of absolution. The ordinary food of the Hindoo is of the simplest character \u2014 pulse, vegetables, fruit, fish, constituting the chief solids upon his table ; water, milk, or clarified butter reduced to a liquid, the fluids with which he regales. Some sects go the length of eating fowl or mutton, and there are not a few who will so far forget their religious obli- \" gations as to indulge in fermented and intoxicating liquors ; but these, with the exception of the Pariahs, to whom no description of food is unpalatable or unwelcome, are the exceptions to the habit of the race. The Mussulman is less scrupulous than the Hindoo ; he objects to no viands that are not cut from the unclean beast, nor is he very rigid in his abstinence from the beverage proscribed by the prophet. The usages of the mass of the people, where they are not regulated by religion, are tolerably uniform. Rising early, they apply themselves to copious ablutions, \u2014 the Hindoo bathing in the waters of the Ganges when accessible ; thence they betake themselves to their temples, or address them selves to their household gods, in the form prescribed by their teachers. The extemporaneous prayer, springing from the rehgion of the heart, is almost unknown. The morning meal, taken in nearly a state of nudity, follows the ceremony of prayer ; then the toilet is made, and the business of the day commences. The merchant, the clerk, the government functionary, all, in short, of the superior orders, whose duty calls them from their homes, preserve their muslin costume, turban, and slippers,* throughout the day ; the artisan, the shopkeeper (except where European customers are numerous), the vendors of goods in pubhc market, the labourer, the * In entering the house of a superior or an equal, the slippers, or shoes, are removed, and left in the vestibule or at the foot of the stairs.

Their domestic utensils are chiefly of copper or of silver. In vessels of such material, or in earthen pots, the meals are prepared, and served up on ' circular flat dishes, placed upon the ground, over a cloth of the commonest texture. The cook (where the food is not dressed by the females of the house) is a person of the same caste as the master, and the greatest care is used, that, while the culinary operations are going on, no person of an inferior sect touches, or even approaches, the utensils. Water is drunk from small copper vessels, but the lips are not permitted to touch the edge of the cup, which is accordingly held an inch or two above the mouth, while the liquid is poured, as it were, into the throat. After each refection, the hookah is brought, and smoked with the gusto which distinguishes the Turkish use of the chi bouque, or the European indulgence in the cigar. Nor is it merely at meal-times that smoking is resorted to by the native.

Whatever may once have been the state of the art sciences amongst the natives of India, they are nov. fessedly at a very low ebb. Their architecture is mono tonous, mixed, and irregular, though the carving of the ornamental parts may be exquisitely beautiful ; their carts, carriages, boats, and agricultural machinery are all rude, cumbrous, and rickety ; their drawing and painting set at defiance form, perspective, light, shade, and harmony ; their astronomy is a puzzle ; their notions of geography crude and limited, and their medicine a quackery. On the other hand, they are ingenious as workers in gold, silver, and ivory; and their achievements in ship-building, under the gui and tutorage of the intelligent Parsee, have elicited the admiration of the European shipwright. For his skill in embroidery, and the fabrication of the finest muslins, 1 1 ,i native of India has likewise obtained a name ; but his tation in this respect, and as a fabricator of rattan and basket-work, is more than counterbalanced by the wor. ness of his attempts at the manufacture of every description of hardware, leather, glass, the implements of trade, crockery, and common cloths. And if in the cultivation of the arts of peace the native. of Hindostan has failed to occupy high ground, still more limited is his knowledge of the art of war. With the lance, the matchlock, the sword, the bow and arrow, fol I weapons, he has never been capable, unaided by Europeans, of organizing a system of tactics, or of introducing into his armies a controlling discipline, at once the source of strength in the peaceful garrison, and formidableness in the field of battle.

That he is deficient in personal courage it were a scandal to pronounce, for while the history of the conflicts during the past century, which have followed the first dissen sions between the European and the native in the south, records innumerable instances of personal intrepidity upon the part of the hordes opposed to the British, our own experience of the sepoys, through whom we have won the country, supplies us with hundreds of thousands of reasons for testifying to their valour, constancy, and fidelity. The condition of the women of India is deplorable, if judged by European views of the right of the sex to at least a moral equality with the lords of the creation. Debarred the advantages of even the most elementary branches of education, the upper classes are held captive in the harem, passing their hours in personal adornment, idle chat, or (if mothers) in performing the duties of nurses ; while on the lower classes are imposed menial offices, household drudgery, and labour in the fields and markets. In no grade of society are the women permitted to eat with their husbands, or to enjoy the society of other males, or to marry again, if left \u25a0widows. Until recently, and even now, where British rule does not extend, conjugal slavery went beyond the grave, or rather the funeral pile (for the Hindoos burn their dead), and the widow had no alternative but to immolate herself with the dead body of her husband, or sink in the estimation of her caste, and become the family drudge. In the foregoing crude and imperfect outline, the usages of the two great classes of which the jiopulation of India is composed, have been sketched. The other races are, for the most part, too insignificant, numerically, or approach in many instances too nearly to the Hindoo and Mussulman, to merit special description in this volume. There are, how ever, three \u2014 the Portuguese, the Eurasians, and the Euro peans \u2014 who are worth particular notice. The Portuguese may be known by his sallow countenance, slovenly gait, and mimicry of European fashion.

The Port society and music, dancing and festivity. Among the D of India generally, the Portuguese are held in contempt All that energy and talent which originated the Portuguese government in India is wholly lost. The Portuguese i rage priestcraft, while their religious teachers place their foot upon the necks of the laymen, and constraining a ve, ficient contribution, live in great content and comfort. The Portuguese seat of government, Goa, is beautifully si: and adorned with palaces and churches, worthy the city founded by the noble-hearted Albuquerque; bu towns which once equally marked their conquests aw grown with brambles, while the glossy snake glides among their tombs, and the timid songster of the wood shelf bright plumage among the rich foliage tangled alike i hall and bower. The Portuguese woman, pretty when young, becomea coarse both in form and nature when advanced in age. She loves gaudy colours, the glare of feasts, the incense of admi ration. The Portuguese is yet admirable as a cook ; and although his deficiency in cleanliness and his love of potent liquors detract somewhat from his merits, yet it must be admitted that the European gastronomist in India is materially a debtor to tbe Portuguese. The Eurasians, a term invented by the late Marquis of Hastings, conventionally accepted as embracing all the geny of white fathers and Hindoo or Mahometan mothers, are as much between the Europeans and natives in their habits and pursuits as in their genealogy, and interfere but Httle with either in the pursuit of susteutation. They are an orderly and intelligent, and in one line, an industrious race of people ; but they are generally devoid of both men tal and personal energy, and are unlikely, therefore, to con stitute a political class in the state of any weight or impor tance. Perhaps there is no class of men, with their educa tional advantages, and their other facilities for acquiring local superiority (supposing the true mental vigour to exist), who have produced so few men of note in any of the depart ments from which such men spring in Europe. In painting,"], [55, "31 THE EURASIAN EMPLOYMENTS. in sculpture, in navigation, in law, in arms, in agriculture, in eloquence, in literature, in science, they have not only not acquired the slightest reputation in Europe or in India (with the two or three exceptions of a Skinner* in war, a Kydt in the higher mechanics, a HutchinsonJ in executive qua lities, and a Sundt \u00a7 in surveying), but they have not even endeavoured to acquire it, because their constitutional tem perament is, by nature's own decree, a bar to the endeavour. Clerkships in the pubhc offices is the line of employment which the body of them look to, and which is manifestly the one best suited to their quiet and unambitious turn of mind. We are aware that they have laboured, and do still labour, under difficulties of position which might have repressed the advancement of a more aspiring race, and this has shallowly been urged in refutation of the opinion that they are inca pable of achieving greatness. But has it ever been observed that they have been incessantly trying to elevate themselves in the social scale, or have they not been quiescent, and apparently attached to the sub-official employment which so easily gives them food ? 1 1 It is nothing, in the way of argu ment, to point to a few individual instances of activity of mind, anel successful striving against obstacles to advance- * Colonel Skinner, commanding a body of irregular horse, raised by himself, and stationed at Delhi.

The army is in general an indolent life for all who choose to be indolent ; but how came it that the Eurasians, if a naturally energetic and vigorous-minded race, did not enter the more arduous lines of life, which were always open to them in their several grades ? The reason is obvious ; and it is no refutation of our argument to show that they made an effort to be rendered eligible for the Company's service, when they have never as a body been found to be active mechanics, industrious agriculturists, enterprising seamen, or daring politicians."], [56, "32 EUROPEANS IN INDIA. ment.

The European, by which we more particularly me;n native of Great Britain, may not change his soul v i skies, but his manners assuredly undergo, in India, a able metamorphosis.

For more than one half of the period of our dominion, the natives were treated as a people who existed only as ministrants to temporary British interests ; we drained the country of its wealth, and offered no compensation for the heavy appropriation. But a better spirit has arisen of late years, and a sound and liberal policy is gradually taking the place of the narrow system of govern ment which erst rendered British rule in the East a bye word and reproach. We have only now to express a hope that every man whose fortune may carry him to India will consider it personally incumbent upon him to return, in some degree, the blessings of ease and competence, which the residence in the country may ultimately confer upon him, by an endeavour to improve the condition of its interesting population. COMMERCE. The external trade of India comprehends not only the commercial intercourse between the various ports in Europe and America with the three presidencies of British India, but the trade carried on by the people of the western coasts, from Scinde to Cape Comorin, and thence to the mouth of the Ganges, and by the people of the Eastern Archipelago and the Burmese coasts, China, Siam, Sumatra, the Dutch settlement of Java, (fee., with each other. England sends to India a large proportion of her manu- factures \u2014 iron, piece-goods, copper, lead, mule-twist, hard- ware, wines, malt liquors, stationery, haberdashery, books, saddlery, jewellery, glass, cheeses, hams, preserves, \u2014 in fact, every sort of production adapted to the wants of civilized life, and to the temperature of the country. France furnishes wines, preserved meats, millinery, porce- lain, and, in a lesser degree, the manufactures of her brilliant metropolis.

The ports to which their vessels speed are not in themselves sources of merchantable comm so much as emporiums for the fruits of other parts of the East, and channels of transit trade, for which their positions so particularly qualify them. It will facilitate the descrip tion to place under their respective heads the articles which each is thus enabled to export, instead of enumerating the various sources of supply. Bombay, as the recipient of the trade of the gulfs of Persia and Arabia, and the northern parts of Western Indii plies cotton and piece-goods from Guzerat ; opium from Malwa ; tea, ivory, silk, lac, gold and silver filigree-work, from China ; cornelians, from Cambay ; ghee, grain, oils, put chock, seeds, tobacco, and soap, from the northern coast ; shawls, drugs, and horses, from Scinde, the Red Sea, an sorah. From the coast of Canara, Bombay derives rice, pep per, betel and cocoa nuts, sarda, cassia, and turmeric ; from the Malabar coast, coir, ginger, ambergris, pepper, teak tim ber, cowries, cardamoms, coculus Indicus, colombo-root, ele- phants' teeth, fish maws, sandal-wood, tamarinds, turmeric, wax, zedoary, coffee, coarse white piece-goods, nankeen from the Maldives, dried fruits, tortoise-shell, and some rude and trifling manufactures. Ceylon yields cinnamon, coffee, cocoa-nuts, coir, oil, wild honey, arrack, areca-nuts, cotton, tobacco, timber, ornamental woods, precious stones, ivory, drugs, dye-stuffs, oleaginous seeds, copperas, pearls, and precious stones of an inferior quality. Madras is the emporium of the trade from Cape Comoml and the whole of the Coromandel coast. Thence we derive piece-goods, called calamaganzies, aunniketches, <fcc, made of a hard long-grained cotton ; long cloths, palanrpores (light counterpanes of printed cotton), coarse plain cloths dyed .with the chaya root, Chicacole muslins, Ellore woollen carpets, Jehapoor salt, Masulipatam tobacco, Vizagapatam ivory, rice, dholl, wax-oil, and a proportion of the produce of the Straits of Malacca. Calcutta, the head-quarters of the trade of Bengal, Behari and Orissa, and of the provinces east, north, and north-west of those extensive districts, exports indigo, saltpetre, sugar;"], [59, "35 IMPORTS. rice, annatto, arrow-root, opium (chiefly sent to China), wheat, terra Japonica, tamarinds, talc, sugar-candy, raw silk, silk piece-goods, flax, ghee, hemp, ginger, hides, horns, lac, lac-dye, oil of roses, riun, safflower, dried fruits, munjeet, black salt (bit nober), borax, castor-oil, chillies, cochineal, coriander, and piece-goods, such as baftas, cossas, dorias, ma- moodies, &c, from Patna, Allahabad, Lucknow, Central India, and Lower Bengal., At the four above-mentioned ports the external trade of all India may be said to be concentrated. We have enume- rated the productions of the continent, but every part of the coasts and islands to the eastward and the south are also tri- butary to their stores in a greater or lesser degree. For ex- ample, she receives from \u2014 Arracan \u2014 Rice, elephants' teeth, wax, wood-oil, and coarse piece-goods.

At the last-named islands, also, the produce of the Eastern Archipelago may be obtained ; but as this is for the most part transmitted either to India or to China, for consumption there, it is scarcely necessary to include it in the commerce with Europe. To complete the description of the produc- tions of the gorgeous and wealthy East, the main items of this local trade from port to port may be enumerated, but the reader is requested to bear in mind, that, to avoid repetition, many articles are omitted which may be found in common at each of the islands : \u2014 Agal, argus feathers, balacharry or agapi (shrimp caviar), gourd-seed, gum benjamin, black wood, kyapootee oil, canes, clove bark, copper, cossumba, ejoo, gambia, shells, lignum aloes, rattans, sago, wood-oil, dragons' blood, patch leaf, brim- d 2"], [60, "36 INDIA SHIPPING. stone, silks, sugars, ivory, salt, betel-nut, tobacco, indigo.

The value of the exports of merchandise from India to the United Kingdom, France, and America, the gulfs of Persia and Arabia, and different parts to the eastward, not including China, is about 1 1 ,000,000.'. from Calcutta alone. In addition to this, treasure to the amount of a third of a million ster ling is annually exported. The declared annual value of British produce and manufactures imported in that quarter, including China, is about 6,000,000^. sterling. It has increased progressively to that amount since 1833, when the trading privileges of the East-India Company were abolished. At that time, the value was not more than three millions and a hah'. The trade with India is carried on in various descriptions of craft. The French and Americans emjdoy vessels of from 300 to 600 tons burthen. Liverpool and the Clyde send out vessels of similar tonnage, while those built and employed by the London merchants range from 400 to 1,200 tons. The trade between Bombay and China employs teak-built ships of 500 to 700 tons measurement ; that from Calcutta to China is carried on in a small description of vessel, ordi narily denominated a clipper, and constructed for the recep tion of chests of opium and tea They are, for the most part, very fast-sailing craft, well manned, and skilfully com manded. The coasting trade between Cambay, on the shores of Guzerat, to the termination of the Malabar coast, is carried on in rude, ill-fashioned native boats, called patta/ma/rs, with high poops ; and a similar description of vessel, called a dfumy, voyages between Madras and the points of the Coromandel coast. The vessel in chief use in the straits of the Eastern Archipelago is called a proa, and much of the trade with the Persian and Arabian gulfs is borne in buggalows and dows. The number of vessels employed in the carrying trade"], [61, "37 DTLAXD TRADE. between the United Kingdom and the ports in the East Indies is about 700.

The neighbouring states can obtain few foreign or tropical productions but through their commercial connection with us. Corn, cotton, oil-producing plants, and sugar, are the principal articles of this inland tirade. Rice, which is grown in such vast abundance up to the twenty-fifth degree of latitude, and the millet and pulses cultivated beyond those limits, are chiefly consumed upon the spot. The cotton-plant, which is of almost universal production in India, from Ceylon to the Himalaya Moun tains, furnishes material for a prodigious variety of fabrics ; and the sugar-cane, which for the most part is grown in the valley of the Ganges, supplies a sugar which is consumed in very considerable quantities in the form of sweetmeats. Besides these main articles, there are a great number of others, such as indigo, salt, opium, silk, tobacco, saltpetre, oils, and oil-skins, drugs, hides, lime, timber, &c, which are objects of the inland trade. These various commodities are paid for by the productions of the coasts, such as spices, teak timber, sandal-wood, and coarse piece-goods ; in the produc tions of foreign tropical countries of Asia, and in the produce and manufactures of Europe and China The tropical or"], [62, "38 INTERNAL CARRIAGE. foreign commodities which are obtained in exchange t Indian produce consist of the areca-nut, spices, metals\u2014 iron, zinc, tin, copper, and lead \u2014 woollens and cottons. The ex tent of the inland trade, in other words, the amount of home manufacture and home consumption, it is extremely difficult to ascertain. The odious tax which formerly existed, under the denomination of transit-duty, and which fun a clue to the computation, has been abolished, and nothing now remains to check the spirit of industry, and bring the choicest fruits of the soil of India. There is no however, that, in proportion as facilities for tho transport of goods from one part of- the vast country to another are augmented, and the charges of trade thereby lessened, an additional impulse will be given to enterprise.

On the Ganges, iron steamers, the pro perty of the Government and of private associations, ply between Calcutta and Allahabad, but the rate of freight is so high, and so large a proportion of the space appropriated to cargo is occupied by baggage and special supplies for the Europeans in the interior, that they can scarcely be included in an enumeration of the river trading-vessels. The standard currency of continental India consists of silver, in coins of the value of about two shillings, and called the rupee. There are copper coins, called pice (four of which represent the anna, the sixteenth part of a rupee), and four anna pieces, which constitute the quarter of a rupee. Of gold, there is scarcely a single coin in circulation. The mohur, which is represented by sixteen rupees, may occa sionally be obtained, and certain coins in existence in the southern parts of India, called pagodas and fanams, may also be seen from time to time, but the exceeding rarity of all these moneys authorizes the assertion that in India gold \u25a0forms no part of the currency. In native transactions, use is made of the cowrie, an exceedingly small shell of the Cyprea species, imported as an article of trade from the Maldive and Laccadive islands. Five thousand one hundred and twenty cowries go to the rupee, whence an inference may be drawn of the extreme poverty of the natives. Paper money forms a very small proportion of the Indian circula tion. Bills of exchange, termed hoondees, are employed as a means of remittance, and are obtained from the native bankers, or shroffs, who are to be found in all the large towns. They are generally written upon small pieces of glazed yellow paper, in a character not easily decipherable by any but the parties whom they more immediately con cern, namely, the agents and correspondents on whom they are drawn, and who are scattered in every part of India, the Punjaub, Affghanistan, and Persia The rest of tbe paper money consists of Treasury notes, bills which the Govern ment permits its civil officers to issue, for an equivalent, to facilitate the remittable operations of their own servants and"], [64, "\u25a010 THE BANKS OF INDIA. others who may wish to avail themselves of the accommod*. tion. The paper-money which circulates in India in the form of bank-notes amounts to a very inconsiderable sum. The banks at the several presidencies are permitted to issue notes, but as they are not all regarded as legal tenders in payment of revenue, the great channel into which, if gene rally current and recognised by the government, they would ultimately flow, their circulation (comparatively small under any circumstances) is materially restrained. Tbe vast capital employed upon the commerce of India is drawn from a variety of sources. England contributes a very large proportion ; her merchants depute parties to estab lish mercantile houses at the several presidencies and ports, and supply them with the means of purchasing produce, encouraging agriculture and local manufactures. The natives, as banians or dubashes (a species of broker to the European houses), or as merchants on their own account, furnish the remainder of the resources. Formerly, all these parties added the business of banking to their other pursuits, and thus derived immense appliances for commerce from the aggregate deposits of their constituents; but the rashness of speculation, the prodigality of personal expenditure, and tho incautiousness with which loans were afforded to parties in all classes of society, and involved in every description of business, led to a bankruptcy that was almost universal, scattering injury far and wide, and striking a fearful blow at the credit of the Indian merchant. Banking, therefore, is now, with comparatively insignificant exceptions, confined to institutions estabhshed exclusively for the operations under stood by that term. There are now eight banks in India,\u2014 the Bank of Bengal (chartered), the Madras Bank (char tered), the Agra and United Service Bank, the Bombay Bank, the Delhi Bank, the Simlah Bank, the Dacca Bank, and the North-West Bank of India. These, for the most part, have branches and agencies at Calcutta, and in other parts of India. There is besides the Oriental Bank, whose head quarters are in London, but which has branches at the several presidencies, and at Ceylon, China, and Mauritius. The chartered banks are, to a certain degree, connected with the state, and are, in part, managed by government officers ; the joint-stock banks rest their claim to support upon tho"], [65, "41 WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. ground of a wealthy co-partnership, each member of which is liable, to the full extent of his means, for the claims Upon the institution. BRITISH INDIAX WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. The unit of the British Indian ponderary system * is called the tola. It weighs 180 grains English troy weight. From it, upwards, are derived the heavy weights, viz. chitak, seer, and mun, or maund ; and by its subdivision the small, or jeweller's weights, called raashas, rutlees, and dhans. The mun (or that weight to which it closely accords in value, and to which it is legally equivalent in the new scale) has been hitherto better known among Europeans by th_e name of bazaar maund ; but upon its general adoption, for all transactions of the British government, it should have been denominated the British maund (in Hindee, Ungrezee mun), to distinguish it at once from all other weights in use throughout the country. The pttsseree is, as its name denotes, a five-seer weight, and therefore should not form an integrant point of the scale ; but, as its use is very general, it has been introduced for the convenience of reference. The seer (weighing 2 Ibs. 6 ozs. troy) being the commonest weight in use in the retail business of the bazaars in India, and being liable, according to the pernicious system hitherto prevalent, to vary in weight for every article sold, as well as for every market, is generally referred to the common unit in native mercantile dealings, as \" the seer of so many tolas11 (or siccas, barees, takas, &c.) ; the standard, or bazaar seer, being always eighty tolas. The chitak, (weighing 1 oz. 17 drs. 12 grs.) is the lowest denomination of the gross weights, and is commonly divided into halves and quarters (called, in Bengalee, kacha) ; thus * The advantages of this system are \u2014 1. That the maund formed from the modified weight would be pre cisely equal to 100 English troy pounds ; and 2. That thirty-five seers would also be precisely equal to seventy-two pounds avoirdupois ; thus establishing a simple connection, void of fractions, between the two English metrical scales and that of India,"], [66, "\u202212 LINEAR AND SQUARE MEASURES. marking the line between the two series, which are otherwise connected by the relation of the seer, &c, to the tola. The tola is chiefly used in the weighing of the precious metals and coin ; all bullion at the mints is received in thi.s denomination, and the tables of bullion-produce (as a the foregoing pages) are calculated per 100 tolas. It usual at the mints to make the subdivisions of the tola into \u25a0annas (sixteenth) and pie, in lieu of mashas and ruttees. Maslias (weighing fifteen grains), ruttees (1*875 grains), and dham, are used chiefly by native goldsmiths and ellers. They are also employed in the native evaluation by assay of the precious metals ; thus ten mashas fine signifies ten-twelfths pure, and corresponds to \" ten-ounce touch\" of the English assay report or silver. There is a closer ac cordance with the English gold assay scale, inasmuch as the ninety-six ruttees in a tola exactly represent the ninety-six carat grains in the gold assay pound, and the dhan, the quarter grain. The accordance of a mim weight with the 100 lbs. troy of England affords a ready means of ascertaining its relative value in the standards of other countries employed in v. ing the precious metals, since tables of the latter are gene rally expressed in pounds troy.

The jealousy with which the legislature watches over the exercise of political power when delegated to British subjects in distant dependencies, and the extreme difficulty of manag ing an immense extent of territory abroad through a single secretary of state, have created a mass of gubernatorial ma chinery for British India, which is as costly as it is unwieldy. That it moves at all, is rather owing to the boldness of the local governors, who often act as emergencies dictate, pre ferring future obloquy to the evils of present delay, than to any particular harmony in the arrangement of the component parts of the complex mechanism. The political government and patronage of India are placed by act of parliament in the hands of the directors of the East-India Company. There are eighteen directors of the East-India Company, ten or more of whom constitute a \" court.\" Of this number, six are appointed by the Crown, \"three from among persons who have served in India for ten years at least ; of the remaining twelve, six must be in dividuals who have resided in India for ten years. The possession of the sum of 1,000?. in East-India stock is the sole money qualification of a director, and he may also be a member of parliament. These directors receive each a salary of 500?., per annum, the chairman and deputy chairman, 1,000-\". each, per annum. The East-India directors are controlled by a Board of Commissioners in England, composed of her Majesty's Mi nisters, the President receiving a salary of 5,000?., per annum. The nature of the control exercised by the President is very arbitrary. He can at any time send a despatch of an autho ritative character to the local governments of India, with or without the consent of the directors, and is absolute on questions of peace or war. A survey of the map of the British possessions in India will satisfy the most cursory observer that it would be per fectly impossible to govern so vast a tract of country from any single point, however advantageously situated such a"], [68, "44 DISTRIBUTION OP GOVERNMENT. position might be. From Cape Comorin in the south, to Peshawur on the Indus in the north \u2014 from Kurrachee, the chief port of Scinde in the west, to Prome, in Burmah, in the east, \u2014 every inch of ground acknowledges British rule, or is, directly or indirectly, subject to British influence. Hence the necessity for placing the territory under several distinct governments, all, however, subordinate to one supreme ruler or governor-general, aided by a council, who in their turn are checked and controlled by the home powers. These local governments are five in number : \u2014 the Go vernor-General of India ; the Governor of Madras (or Fort St. George) ; the Governor of Bombay ; the Lieutenant- Governor, or Governor of the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal ; the Lieutenant-Governor of the North Wi Provinces. Each of the governors of presidencies is assisted by a council of two civil members, in addition to a military member, who is also Commander-in-Chief. There is likewise a Legislative Council, for the making of laws, which consists ofa member from each Presidency and Lieutenant-Governor ship, who may have been ten years in the civil service ; the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort Wilham; one of the other Judges of the Supreme Court, \u2014 and, when necessary, two extra councillors, who, however, only sit and vote at the meetings of the council convened for making laws and regulations. The salaries of the Lieutenant-Governors of Bengal and the North Western Provinces are 10,000?. per annum each; of the ordinary members of Council, 8,000?. each ; and of the Legislative Councillors, 5,000?. each. The armies of the three presidencies have distinct Oom manders-in-Chief; but the officer who commands the Bengal army, is called \" Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in India,\" and when necessary, exercises supreme and exclusive control over the troops at each presidency. His salary is 10,000?. per annum, in lieu of all other pay and allowances. To assist the Supreme Government of India in fulfilling its important trust, a highly- educated civil service, consisting of some hundreds of members, is placed at its disposal by the home administration, and an army of about 250,000 men, principally natives of India, commanded by European officers, and divided into regular infantry, irregular and local horse"], [69, "\u25a015 MODE OF GOVERNMENT. and foot, and a due proportion of artillery, engineers, and sappers. The police duties are performed by large and welt trained bodies of natives, guided and directed by British officers, selected from those most remarkable for courage, in telligence, and a knowledge of the native character. The manner in which the business of government is carried on will appear to those who are familiar with the method of proceeding in England tedious and changeable, almost all transactions being conducted through the medium of official correspondence, carried through a variety of channels. But this is the unavoidable result of the responsibility of the local administration to the two supervising authorities in England. When every thing has to be formally reported to the controlling power, every thing must necessarily be placed an record ; and, as reference may continually have to be made to the official communications on the spot, the original documents are retained, and copies, in duplicate, forwarded to the Court of Directors and the Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India. The voluminous correspondence between the Government and its officers is, therefore, multi plied by four, and sometimes oftener, thus rendering the machinery of the secretariat extremely cumbrous and costly. The method of transacting pubhc affairs in India may be thus briefly described. Every officer of Government charged with the management of political, financial, military, muni cipal, revenue, pohce, ecclesiastical, judicial, marine, medical, ar other matters, either addresses the authorities direct (ad vising, reporting, or soliciting instructions and assistance), ar through the functionaries and boards intrusted with the immediate control of the several departments of the execu tive. These communications, amounting to many scores per diem, are laid by the respective secretaries to the Government before the Council Board, and they are duly discussed, and orders issued thereupon, in conformity with the sentiments of the majority of the members. The initials of the Council on the back of the letter of tbe authority addressing them direct, are, in the majority of instances, a sufficient guide to the secretarial officers ; but where the question discussed is of importance enough to elicit elaborate or precise expres sions of opinion, the members of the Government place on record separate minutes, from the aggregate of which the"], [70, "46 MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENT. decision or ultimate resolution is deduced. On these occasions, where the council is much divided, the governor general, or governor, has power to adopt his own views, though they may be at variance with those of the whule body of his colleagues ; but this is a prerogative e.\\. only in cases of great emergency, the more ordinary i in such circumstances being, to refer the disputed question to the arbitrement of the home authorities. It will be obvious, from this concentration of the govern ment of so vast an empire, that the members of the admi-. nistration must be men of very considerable and varieil at tainments ; for though they may not originate the multitu dinous measures carried into effect almost daily for the of the country and the integrity of the British p< isai they must possess a capacity for determining upon th priety of yielding assent to propositions submitted for their consideration. Care, therefore, is taken to select for the functions of government as great a variety of ability as so small a council is susceptible of containing. The governors are generally chosen from the statesmen in tbe mother-coun try who have manifested a taste, and capacity for public bu siness, and to whom Indian affairs ate not entirely caviare, or from the public servants of the East-India Company, whose high character, long services, and extensive local expe rience, point them out as peculiarly fitted for the important trust. The commanders-in-chief, in almost every instance, have earned distinction in the wars of Europe, Asia, or Africa, and are familiar with the science of organizing and disciplining large forces. They carry with them to India a thorough knowledge of the principles of civilized warfare, and an ac quaintance with the interior economy of an army \u2014 qualities which, combined with a stern sense of duty and a lofty chi valry, atone for the temporary absence of local knowledge, and enable them, while acquiring requisite information, to impart a wholesome spirit to the legions intrusted to their command. The other members of the Council are gentlemen of the civil service, who have served for many years in re venue, judicial, political, or secretarial offices, \u2014 or in all of those branches, \u2014 and acquired therein a high official repu tation. In the Supreme Council there are two additional members, one of whom is selected from the senior oflicerSr"], [71, "47 WRITERSHIPS. for his superior acquaintance with the affairs of the Indian army, and his regard for its interests, and the other for his legal attainments and familiarity with the principles of Bri tish polity. The salaries of all these officers are liberal, but not more than sufficient for the degree of state which is al most inseparable from exalted life in India, and for the annual contribution to useful and charitable pubhc objects. The Governor-General receives 25,000?. per annum, and is pro vided with a splendid palace at Calcutta, and a rural residence at Barrackpore, sixteen miles from the presidency. The go vernors of the other presidencies (Madras and Bombay) re^ ceive 12,000?. a year, and are similarly domiciled. The Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces and the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal each receive 10,000?. The ordinary members of the Supreme Council receive each 8,000?. per annum ; the Legislative Councillors each 5,000?. ; of Madras and Bombay, each 6,000?. ; the Commander-in-; Chief, 10,000?., and very often the off-reckonings of a regi ment of which he may be the colonel. For a considerable number of years after the East-India Company had acquired large territorial possessions in India, the gentlemen sent out to fill the various civil offices of the government were selected without any peculiar references to qualification. A writership was considered a provision for life, if not a source of large ultimate fortune ; for if the salary was not liberal, the opportunities of gain, by means of trade and other less honourable proceedings, were numerous ; while a knowledge of languages and of official business would, it was considered, be acquired in due course of time. The evil working of this loose system, however, at all times par tially obvious, was the more apparent as the demand for talent augmented, and rigid integrity and an independence of native connection became a sine qui non of good govern ment. It was then that the Company began to devise plana of home education for parties aspiring to serve them in the civil departments abroad. Character, connections, and a certain stock of knowledge, were declared the essential concomitants of a writership, though merely preparative to other qualifications, of which the candidate was to possess himself in India. This declaration was a material step towards the improvement of the service ; but it was not"], [72, "48 THE CIVIL SERVICE. until the year 1809, when the college of Haileylmry, in Hertford, was founded, that the education of the future civilian resolved itself into a system, the adherence to has since been uniform. A few years ago some exe, | to a collegiate education were made in favour of young men who had earned much distinction at some of the other great public schools or colleges, and who were honoured with pre sentations of Indian appointments by Presidents of the Board of Control, or Chairmen of the Direction, anxious to promote individual merit ; but until the present year all the civil officers in the service of the East-India Company were obliged to receive instruction at the Haileybury College, the nomination to which was dependent upon regulations and preparatory instructions. By the Act passed in last year, the civil service has been thrown open to pubhc competi tion, under rules and regulations wliich will be found in the Appendix. On the arrival of a writer at either of the presidencies, be is allowed a twelvemonth to master one of the languages principally required in the transaction of public business. During this interval he draws the unemployed salary of three hundred rupees per mensem, and a small sum for a moonshee. When the period allotted, or supposed to be allotted, to special Oriental studies has expired, the student presents himself to a local board of examination. If he passes with tolerable credit, he is pronounced qualified for the pubhc service, and is at once \"attached,\" in a subordinate capacity, to the establishment of a judge, a collector, or a magistrate, or, in remarkable instances of great interest, to the secretariat, customs, or accountant-general's department, at the presidency to which he may be nominated. Should the candidate, however, fail to obtain a certificate of qualifi cation from the examiners ; in other words, should he, through natural incapacity or indolence, be unsuccessful in displaying the requisite amount of Oriental learning, he is sent back to his studies for six weeks, at the end of which period he must either establish the possession of the requisite qualifications, or he is shipped to England, as a hopeless subject, and deprived of his appointment in the Company's service. When we consider the immense extent of the territorial"], [73, "49 DUTIES AND EMOLUMENTS OF CIVILIANS. dependencies of the East-India Company, and the circum stances of the vast population by which they are occupied, it is not difficult to conjecture that the civil officer who desires to acquire honour for himself and his masters, and to make his native fellow-subjects participate in the blessings of good government, has an awful and an arduous task imposed upon him. He has frequently to exercise authority over a district comprising an area not inferior in extent to three or four of the largest provinces in Great Britain (in some instances a space as large as the whole of Ireland has been under the control of one man) ; and as he has only two or three European assistants, and a body of native functionaries \u2014 on the trustworthiness and activity of wliich latter, by the way, perfect reliance cannot always be placed \u2014 his heavy responsi bility and severe labour may be tolerably well understood. It is true that he has his head-quarters at some central station, whither suitors, land-rent payers, applicants for redress, &c, repair in crowds ; but the importance of personal investiga tion into the affairs of a district begets the necessity for loco motion, and as India does not as yet offer the same facilities for rapidity of movement as Great Britain or the United States, the judge, magistrate, or collector, is compelled peri odically to travel into remote, and often unhealthy parts of the country ; living in tents, and regaling on such fare as the neighbouring villages can supply, or he may have been enabled to transport from his permanent domicile. But the civil service has its agrimens, as well as its in conveniences. The salaries are large, varying from 500?. to 10,000?. per annum ; and the furlough allowance and re tiring annuity handsome and all-sufficient. The leading civilian is the acknowledged head of the society of whatever place he may be stationed at, while the juniors are regarded, as much from their position as their generally superior attainments, with deference and respect. The sports and pastimes peculiar to the country (hunting, shooting, racing, &c.) are accessible to him upon a scale of magnificence and affluence unknown to the English sportsman, who ranges the fields with his gun and a brace of pointers, and seeks no nobler game than the partridge or the hare. If he is in the political hne, occupying the office of resident at a native court, he holds a position neither less honourable, less E"], [74, "50 FURLOUGH REGULATIONS. responsible, nor less associated with the elegancies of Jif,. (rendered accessible by his large salary), than a British ambassador on the continent of Europe. In this, and indeed in all the other offices of trust, he acquires a fitn, serious avocations elsewhere ; and this capacity, supported by the renown he has earned, frequently recommends him for responsible offices upon his return to England.* But of all the advantages of the position of the civilian, none aro so enviable as the opportunities afforded him of spreading happiness amongst the thousands of human beings | under his protection. Through his instrumentality, the cause of education, and, therefore, of Christian enlighten ment, may be advanced \u2014 his charities, judiciously dispensed, will save myriads from starvation \u2014 and the encouragement he has it in his power to give to the labourer by building bridges, constructing roads, and draining lands, will confer the blessing of employment upon the industriously disposed, while it gives an impulse to the internal commerce of the country, and diffuses health in regions of disease. A vague allusion has been made above to the furlough and retiring advantages of the civil service. A more parti cular description of them seems called for. At each presi dency there are funds to which civilians contiibute a per centage upon their salaries, and other public emoluments, to entitle them to retire aster twenty-two years' actual service in India, upon an annuity of 1,000?. Should they be com pelled by ill health to quit the service before the expiry of that period, they receive lesser sums, 250?. per annum for more than ten and less than fifteen years' service ; 500?. for upwards of fifteen years, and less than the full regulated period And if sickness drives them permanently to Eng land before they have even completed ten years' service, they are paid a donation of 500?. After ten years' service, a civilian is allowed a furlough to Europe for three years, receiving during that interval, 500.. per annum \u2014 always supposing that the number of gentlemen who may avail * The appointment of Sir C. Metcalfe to the government, su cce\u00bb sively, of Jamaica and Canada, of Sir H. Pottinger to the office of envoy extraordinary to the Chinese court, and of Sir C.

Some changes in the furlough rules are in contemplation, and should they have been carried out before this volume issues from the press, they will be found in the Appendix. In addition to these provisions, all of which, it should be remembered, are accompanied by conditions duly set forth in sundry codes of regulations, there are funds which particu larly provide for the widows and ..children of deceased civil functionaries, upon a scale sufficiently liberal to remove all scruples concerning settlements from the minds of hesitating spinsters, in the first instance, and to relieve husbands and fathers from any anxiety upon the subject of their widows and orphans, in the second. In conclusion, it may be mentioned, that any civil servant who, on proceeding to England on leave of absence, shall fail to return to India before the expiry of five years, is dis qualified for further service, unless it be found that such continued absence was the result of sickness or infirmity, or unless his return is sanctioned by a vote or resolution passed at a meeting of the Proprietors of East-India Stock. Another circumstance which involves the penalty of dis missal at any period during the service of a civil officer is, the discovery that his appointment in the first instance was obtained by any pecuniary or other corrupt arrangement with the party in whom the presentation lay. The only exception to the penalty is, the free and voluntary disclosure of the transaction when a Director of the Company has been implicated therein. THE ARMY. It has been contended of late years, by some public writers, that we hold India entirely by the force of opinion ; that is to say, that we are permitted to rule simply because the principles of justice and equity, and a respect for the e 2"], [76, "52 INFLUENCE OF THE ARMY. religious usages of the thousands under our sway, are carried out to the fullest extent compatible with human frailty. On the other hand, it has been argued that on empire is held entirely by the sword ; and our wars, victo ries, and their political results, have been pointed at as evidence of the soundnesses the theory. Truth lies, in most cases, between extremes, and there seems httle reason to doubt that such is its proper position in the present instance. The highest opinion that might be entertained of our character as governors, would of itself, we apprehend, avail but little in the retention of the country against the schemes of disaffected or designing men, if it were not backed by a well-organized and judiciously-distributed physical force. If there were no descendants of the countless chieftains who once held possession of the country, eager, upon any pretext supported by opportunity, to assert fanciful claims to terri tory or to privileges ; if there were no frontier foes, whose incursions it were necessary to resist or prevent, as much for the sake of the peace and happiness of the people as for the maintenance of British supremacy ; there would still be evil powers within the heart of the empire against whose machi nations the greatest amount of political integrity could not successfully contend. The Hindoo and the Mussulman arc priest-ridden ; the Hindoo and the Mussulman are alike avaricious. What elements more potent than priestcraft and avarice to excite a populace to rebellion ? While the zemindar's disinclination to pay his rent ignited the spark of insurrection, on the one hand, there would not be wanting the ambition and the self-interest of the Brahmin, and the savage religious fervour of the Moollah, to fan the flame, upon the other. The sword, therefore, is an indispensable agent in the retention of India ; and it is a happy thing for the populace of that empire, that the mercy and humanity which distinguish the administration of the civil government attemper the steel by which the sedition of the disaffected and the incursion of the foreign foe are invariably chast it-ed. A rough statement has been given above of the strength of the armies of the several presidencies. A more precise estimate is essential in a work of this description.

The officers are 215 in number. There is a considerable body, also, of invalids and veterans ; but as they cannot, in fairness, be in cluded in the physical strength of the government, there is no necessity for taking particular account of them."], [78, "54 THE STAFF. Out of the 300,000 men who compose the East-India Company's troops in India, not more than 7,800 are European officers ; and, of this number, at least 700 are generally absent on furlough, and a great many are on the staff, or in charge of local corps, or otherwise employed. The proportion of regimental effective officers is therefore extremely small ; and although they are aided in the ordinary routine duties of a garrison by the native commissioned officers, and experi ence little trouble in managing the happy and tractable sepoy in cantonments, their numerical deficiency has exposed armies to serious risks in the field, where the example of European intrepidity has been of the last consequence in rallying na tive troops at a critical juncture. At the battle of _ 1 fought in 1843, it was remarked by the commander of the forces engaged (Sir C. Napier), that the fall of a European officer was invariably the signal for sepoy-faltering, and that if others had not been at hand to at once supply the place of the stricken leaders, the action must have had a different and far less glorious termination. Situations on the general staff, to which officers are eligible after four years of actual service in India, and a passage through the ordeal of an examination in one of the native languages, are handsomely endowed, the salaries varying from two hundred to forty thousand rupees (4,000?.) per annum ; the incumbent, however, in some cases relinquishing a pro portion of his regimental emoluments. In former times, and especially upon the settlement of a newly-conquered country, military men were frequently selected to fill the important civil offices of revenue collectors, magistrates, superintendents of pohce, political agents, &c. ; but the very natural jealousy of the civil servants, and the demand for the professional services of soldiers, caused the selection to be discontinued as a system. The government, however, still finds it neces sary to avail itself of the aid of military officers in the civil branch, more particularly in the departments of police, in tracts of country recently evacuated by regular troops. But apart from these offices, the staff provides honourable and lucrative employment in a variety of ways. The departments of the adjutant, auditor, quartermaster, surveyor, paymaster, judge-advocate, and commissary general ; the offices of bri gade-major, aide-de-camp, barrackmaster, secretary to the Military Board, clothing-agent, superintendent of studs, (fee,"], [79, "55 THE STAFF. are all filled by officers withdrawn from regimental duty ; and it is very rare (excepting in instances of field service, when every officer is required to join his corps), that the ap pointment passes from the hands of the fortunate possessor until his promotion to exalted regimental rank disqualifies him for a subordinate occupation on the staff. No officer can hold a staff appointment until he has been two years in the army. Regimental advantages are likewise dependent on qualification. No officer can obtain the command of a troop or company until he has attained a sufficient knowledge of the colloquial and written language of the country, and of the duties of the superior step. Candidates are re quired to read and translate correctly the Bagho Buhar, and the Bytal Pucheesee, the former in Persian, the latter in the Deva Nagree character, and to translate into Hindoostanee in an easy narrative style some passages from Enghsh ; the translation to be written legibly both in Per sian and Deva Nagree. The colloquial knowledge of the language is tested by the examiners. The same rules apply to assistant surgeons, who cannot draw the staff salary an nexed -to the charge of native troops unless they have passed an examination. For the guidance of all candidates for military service in India, under the auspices of the East-India Company, we have given in an Appendix to this book, such rules and regu lations as may at once aid them in obtaining admission into the army, and in acquiring a knowledge of some of the con ditions and advantages of their future profession. It should be premised, that for the infantry and cavalry branches of the service, education at the Military College is not indis pensable ; it is enough if they have been prepared by com petent tutors to undergo an examination in Latin, French, or Hindoostanee, algebra, six books of Euclid, history, geography, &c. ; while, for the artillery and engineers, it is a condition of the presentation of a cadetship that the can didate should have gone through a regular course of instruc tion at Addiscombe. The rules of the Military and Retiring Funds will be found in the Appendix.

INDIAN NAVY AND MARINE DEPARTMENT. About half a century ago, when the Coromandel and Malabar coasts were visited by pirates and French priva. and the trade between the Persian and Aralii.m null's and India was interrupted by rovers who hoisted the black signal of the professional freebooter, or the scarcely less suspicious blood-red flag of the ostensible Arab trader, the East-India Company kept up a flotilla of gun-brigs. They were i for the most part, cruisers ; and their officers and crew com posed a body, then known by the name of Tlie Bombay Ma rine. The men were, for the most part, drawn from the merchant-vessels in the harbour \u2014 the officers were sent out by the Court of Directors as midshipmen, whence they rose by gradation to the rank of captains. The history of our trade in India, and of our political occupation of the country, presents many brilliant pro the skill aud prowess of the Bombay Marine, whether in con flict with hordes of desperate pirates, or in more organized operations, in conjunction with other sea and land forces, against the strongholds of enemies on the shores of India, Persia, or Burmah. But there is no question that the state of discipline on board those cruisers was low ; the rank of the officers, relatively with that of the members of other warlike professions, was undetermined ; the pay and allowances were insignificant ; and altogether there was a deficiency of that pride and self-respect, without which no service can ac quire the esteem of the rest of civilized mankind, or advance its own consequence amongst contemporary professions. To remedy this state of things, an effort was made, and with complete success, during his late Majesty William the Fourth's occupancy of the office of Lord High Admiral, to exalt the character of the marine by giving it the title of T/te Indian Navy, and honouring it with the control of an experienced officer of the British navy. In all respects \u2014 uniform, emolu ments, rank \u2014 it was placed upon a just level with the royal service ; and although this salutary change came at a time when maritime war in the East had ceased, and steam had begun to facilitate the communication of the eastern with the western world, and therefore to demand of the naval"], [83, "59 NAVAL STRENGTH AND COMPOSITION. officer science and moral courage, in addition to, if not in substitution of, prowess, there is no doubt that the service very largely benefited by the experiment. The Indian navy now consists of 1-50 officers, of whom six are captains, twelve commanders, forty-eight lieutenants, and the remainder mates, midshipmen, and pursers. The staflT offices, and the situation of superintendent, are filled, at the pleasure of the home government, by experienced members of the British navy, or retired officers of the famous mercan tile marine of the East-India Company of Merchants. The fleet, officered and commanded by the Indian navy, amounts to forty vessels, of which more than one-half are armed steamers variously employed in keeping up the communica tion between India and China, India, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf, China and the Red Sea, Bombay and Sinde, and in the navigation of the Indus. The remainder of the vessels are sailing sloops, brigs, and schooners, employed on surveys, or in the protection of trade in the western gulfs and the Straits of Malacca. Great and important service has been rendered in the survey department by officers of the Indian navy ; amongst the most illustrious of whom stand the names of Captain Lloyd and Captain Moresby ; to the former, the merchant service is indebted for some invaluable charts of the dangerous approaches to the shores of Bengal, and of the intricacies of the mighty Ganges ; while to the latter belongs the honour of having ascertained and pro claimed the full extent of the perils of the Red Sea, the Maldives, and the Malabar Coast, and rendered that plain sailing which had previously been avoided as difficult and hazardous navigation.

As good morals are an essential ingredient in good govern ment, and a well-endowed, active, and pious body of Chris tian ministers necessaiy to the maintenance and encourage ment of sound morality, the ecclesiastical establishment of British India is properly regarded as one of the most impor tant arms and instruments of the executive. The principlo of protection to the Protestant church, so long recognised by the government of Great Britain as indispensable to the common weal, is therefore carried out in India to tlie I possible extent. While the British legislature limits it . .-If to the preservation of Protestantism in the person of the sovereign, the endowment of Protestant institutions, the selection of members of the Protestant persuasion to fill .great public offices, and the enforcement of taxes for the partial support of the church, the government of India builds churches at its own expense, and takes upon itself the entire support of the English and Scotch (established) clergy. Three bishops, as many archdeacons, and upwards of one hundred Protestant chaplains, are spread over British India ; and their several incomes, varying from 6001. to 2,0001 per annum (the bishop of Calcutta receiving as much as 4,0 0 (__. per annum), are paid monthly from the state coffers. The chaplains generally receive their appointments at the hands of the Court of Directors in England, but it is within the competency of the bishop of Calcutta to admit to holy orders young men who have studied at the college on the banks of the Hooghly, founded by Bishop Middleton in 1820, and to nominate them to share in the duties which devolve on the chaplains generally. The number who have been thus admitted is, however, small, as the college scarcely supplies enough to fulfil its own original purpose, namely, the pro- pagation of the gospel among the heathen by means of missionaries. The duties of the British clergy in India are by no means light : excepting at the chief towns of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, and the great military cantonments of Lahore pore, Meerut, Poonah, Secunderabad, and Bangalore, but one chaplain officiates at each station ; on him, consequently, de-"], [87, "63 CHAPLAINS AND ASSISTANT CHAPLAINS. volves not merely the performance of<all the parts of divine ser vice, but the ceremonies of baptism, marriage, and burial ; the duties of visiting the hospital and the chamber ofthe sick man at places very remote from head-quarters; the superintendence of schools and charitable institutions ; the assisting mission aries of the Church of England in the translation and dif fusion of the Scriptures (but this is not a compulsory duty) ; and generally affording co-operation in every description of good work within his sphere. These combined offices severely tax the time of the Christian minister, leaving him but little space for reflection or recreation ; but it does not appear that temperate and systematic men sink under the accumulation, even in so fierce a climate as that of India ; and there is this comfort in store for the district clergyman, that every vacancy in the senior ranks places him higher on the list, and brings him nearer to the enviable possession of a chaplaincy at the presidency, with comparative leisure, and a harvest of marriage, burial, and christening fees. The regulations for the admission of chaplains into the service of the East-India Company are as follow : \u2014 Candidates for appointments as assistant chaplains must have been two years in orders, and must not exceed forty years of age ; and at the time of appointment are required to produce their letters of orders, deacon and priest, as well as a testimonial, signed by three beneficed clergymen, and a medical certificate ; the appointments are made subject to the approval of the archbishop of Canterbury or the bishop of London. Chaplains are required to enter into covenant, and to give a bond for 5001., jointly with two sureties, for the due fulfil ment of the same. Under the deed of covenant, chaplains are required to subscribe to the Military Fund at the presidency to which they may be attached. Chaplains must proceed to their destination within six months from the date of the Court's resolution by which they were nominated ; and in failure thereof, without leave obtained from the Court, their appointments will lapse. The salary of an assistant-chaplain, which position is generally retained for about seven years, does not exceed 6001. per annum ; and for the first year several deductions"], [88, "64 LAWS, POLICE, THE PRESS. are made on account of donations and subscriptions to certain funds from which he, or his surviving family, should hi dit die prematurely, will ultimately derive particular ix After eighteen years' service, including a furlough on sick certificate, and on private affairs, a chaplain is per mitted to retire upon the pay of a major, viz. 292 annum ; after ten years' service (if compelled by ill health to quit the service), on the half-pay of a major, viz. 1731. Is. Gd. per annum ; and after seven years (bj \u25a0 recent decision), on G3Z. 17s. 6d. per annum ; and their widows to one-half that sum. When a chaplain has served seven years, he is allowed a furlough to England, receiving during such absence the pay of captain, viz. 191\u00a3 12\u00bb. per annum. The widows of chaplains who have actually - fifteen years in India receive pensions as widows of majors. The Military Funds allow to subscribers a sum for passage-money and equipment, if they are not in a position to incur expenses on these accounts from their own , or entitled to draw upon the government treasury ; and to the widow of a chaplain, who is not in possession of a ccrt_iii_ specified sum, they allow passage-money, and a pension, varying according to the presidency to which the chaplain may have belonged, from 120_ to 205^. 6s. 3d. per annum. LAWS, POLICE, THE PRESS. While a body of experienced lawyers and well-informed civil servants are engaged in the preparation of a a laws applicable to India, and, pending the completion of their labours, procure from time to time the passage of enactments which provide for temporary difficulties, vre must consider the system of judicial administration in our Eastern possessions as in a partial state of transition. Enough of the intentions of the law commissioners has, how ever, been shadowed forth, to wan-ant the impression that the great framework of the laws will be left intact ; that the sytem of jurisprudence now extant will only be modified to suit the improved state of society, and that simplification will supersede the complexity which at present obtains. The laws wliich prevail at this moment in India are based"], [89, "65 THE BAR OF INDIA. upon the Mahomedan code, excepting at the three presiden cies and the islands of Penang and Ceylon, where, within certain narrow limits, the British laws are administered upon precisely the same principles, and regulated by the same statutes as govern our courts in England. Much of the ancient Hindoo law having reference to questions of title, inheritance, succession, marriage, adoption, and caste, has entered into the Mahomedan system, but no separate and well-defined Hindoo code has existed from the date of the consolidation of the Moslem power. But two distinct systems of laws are therefore current throughout the length and breadth of British India. The Supreme, or Queen's Courts, at the three presidencies and the islands, consist each of three judges,* selected by ministers from the practising barristers in England. The selection has often been eminently judicious. Sir William Jones and Sir James Mackintosh have a European reputa- tion. The advocates of the courts consist of men who, hav- ing been called to the bar in England, are induced, by the hope of realizing an independence, to transport themselves to India. They are, for the most part, men of average capacity ; but there have been instances of great talent adorning the courts, especially that of Calcutta ; and it is to the honour of the profession that when public questions have arisen, in which the government and the governed were antagonistic, the Bar have almost invariably been found ranged on the weaker side, employing their eloquence and their energy to baffle oppression, and wring from the execu- tive the concession of great privileges. To the brilliant exertions of the Calcutta bar, the Indian community are indebted for effective resistance to an iniquitous stamp act, for the liberty of the press, for the free ingress of intelligent and independent Europeans ; and, in point of fact, for very many advantages, unconnected with the laws, which have inspired the natives with a greater degree of self-respect, and rendered Englishmen as secure of their birthrights in India as they are in their native land. The attorneys, like the * There are but two judges at present sitting in the Bombay Court, and as no disposition has for some time past been shown by the home authorities to appoint a third, it is supposed that the number wiH henceforth be permanently limited to two. r"], [90, "66 JURISDICTION OF COURTS. barristers, have, for the most part, received their education and served their apprenticeship in London; but o years a good many have been admitted who began as art clerks in local offices ; and it must be confessed, that if they are deficient in the higher qualities which distinguish citor, their familiarity with the character and language of the natives gives them advantages which their competitors are many years in acquiring. The extent of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts is not so exactly defined aa to silence all discussion upon tlie point, but, generally speaking, their respective charters have settled their powers as to the nature of the law they are at liberty to administer. These are extensive. Ever* which in London would be heard either in the Court of Queen's Bench or Common Pleas, Admiralty or Ecclesiastical Courts, Courts of Chancery, Exchequer, or Insolvency, comes under the cognizance of the Supreme Courts in India, and from their decision there is no appeal but to tfie Queen in Council. . Unlike the judges of the Company's courts, the administrators of the law in the Queen's courts are totally independent of tbe local government. Brute force might) iu extreme cases, be opposed to the execution of their decrees ; but their offices cannot be taken from them, on the one hand, as a punishment for the stern and upright execu tion of their duty ; nor, on the other hand, could they be tempted by anything the highest authorities have it in their power to bestow, to deviate from the straight path chalked out to them by the dictates of conscience and the obligation of their oath. The Company's judicial establishments in the interior of Hindostan consist of a great number of courts, of various degrees of power and responsibility. At each presidency are Supreme Native Courts, consisting of four judges each, chosen from the most experienced officers in the judicial line. At the principal stations are courts of circuit. In every zillah, or district, and in each great and populous city, there is a single judge. Besides these, there are assistant judges, registers of zillahs, who hold courts ; and many native petty judges, under the appellations of sudder ameens and moonsiffs, the former term signifying \" chief arbitrator,\" and the latter \" a justice,\" or one who distributes justice."], [91, "67 OBSTACLES TO JUSTICE. From the inferior courts lie appeals to the courts of circuit, and from the courts of circuit to the presidency courts, in all civil causes of any considerable amount, in questions of real property, and even in personal actions involving a cer- tain sum of money ; and from the courts of circuit refer- ences are necessary to the superior tribunal, in criminal con- victions involving life or transportation. The Mahomedan law (as we have said above), modified by innumerable regu- lations, rules, and ordinances, passed by the government from time to time, is the law of all these courts ; and if it were possible to carry out its provisions to the letter, the people would have less ground for the complaint that justice, as administered therein, exists merely in name. But the obstacles to a correct administration of the law are immense. The ignorance of the native pleaders ; the corruption of the omlah, or native officers of the courts ; the prevalence of perjury among all classes of native witnesses ; the impossi- bility of checking oppression in the execution of decrees ; the consumption of justice in the progressive system of appeal from the lowest upwards, which holds out a tempta- tion to litigation by multiplying the chances of success ; the imperfect knowledge possessed by the Anglo-Indian judges of the multitude of dialects, and of the customs, manners, and ideas of the natives \u2014 constitute so many serious impe- diments to the healthy course of law, that justice, to use the words of an enlightened writer upon the subject, becomes e, \" perfect caput mortuum, not worth the having.\" The causes which chiefly engage the attention of the judicial officers in India arise out of failure to pay revenue, disputed succession or inheritance, breach of contract, debt, and trespass. The crimes they have principally to try are larceny, robbery on the highway, burglary, murder, forgery, piracy, aud perjury. The punishments which they are com- petent to inflict are death, imprisonment, labour on the roads, transportation to the Straits of Malacca, and confisca- tion of property. Juries, composed of Europeans, Eura- sians, and educated natives, are empanelled to try criminal causes only in the presidency Queen's courts ; but the insti- tution is unknown in the interior, excepting in the form of a pwnchayat, or jury of five individuals, who are occasionally F 2"], [92, "68 THE T0LICE OF INDIA. called in to aid the judge, as assessors, in cases of doubt and difficulty. The police in India is probably the worst prevent i detective establishment of any in the world. The activity and zeal of magistrates and superintendents are almost entirely neutralized by the apathy, cowardice, and corruption of the posse comitatus.

Thus, the difficulty experienced by the judges in administering the law is materially enhanced, and the | pay a heavy tax for the maintenance of an institution with which, under present circumstances, they could, with rare exceptions, most easily dispense. But one remedy for this state of things appears to exist, and that is, the employment of some hundreds of Europeans as inspectors and superin tendents of police in all the districts. Well-disciplined and intelligent soldiers would be the fittest persons for this de scription of office, which would, at the same time, be a reward for good conduct, and a motive for the enlistment of young men from the respectable classes now struggling for existence in England. At the presidencies there are a few European constables and bailiffs, and their great efficiency supplies an unanswerable argument in favour of the exten sion of such description of control to every town and popu lous village in the country."], [93, "69 LANGUAGES. THE LANGUAGES OF INDIA The earliest of the languages known to and used by the people of India is the Sanscrit, or Sunscrit. It was the lan- guage of the Brahmins, and used by them in the preparation of the Vedas or Sacred Books. The character in which it was written was called the Deva Negri. Neither the lan- guage nor the character are now in use, although traces of both are to be found to a considerable extent in the nume- rous languages spoken and written in the East. Between the Indus and Ceylon, no less than twenty-one distinct lan- guages are employed in different provinces, some of them partaking of the character of those of the countries upon the frontiers, and others, especially the Hindostanee (or Moors, as it is often called), founded entirely upon the Persian, in- troduced by the Mahomedan conquerors. Independently of the Hindostanee, which is more or less spoken throughout the empire, there are twenty-one distinct tongues in use in India. The Cingalese language is spoken only in Ceylon. In Travancore Malayalim is in use. Tamvl is the language of the south-eastern part of the peninsula. The Canarese or Karnota is peculiar to Mysore. In the eastern part of the Nizam's territories, to the Coromandel Coast, we find the people spealdng Teloogoo or Telinga. From Bombay in the west, to Nagpore in the east, and throughout the districts lying between the Nerbudda and the Kistna, Mahratta is general ; it is also the language of Gwalior. Bengalee is of course the language of Bengal \u2014 as Cashmerar, Punjabee, Sindee, Colatee, Asamese, and Nepalese are severally the lan- guages of the States whence they derive their names. The Cole and Goond tongues are current in the tract of country lying between the 19\u00b0 and 24\u00b0 parallels of latitude, and 80\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 long ; bounded on the west by the Deccan, on the north-west by Oude and Bajpootana, on the east by Cuttack, and the north-east by Bengal. In Oude, Oordoo and Hindee are the popular languages ; and Hindee, with its various dialects, is likewise the language of the extensive provinces of Bajpootana and Bundlecund. The people of Burmah, of Bhotan, and Belooch, have languages of their own, deriving their appellations from the several countries"], [94, "70 THE TRESS OF INDIA. in which they are used. Guzerat has also a separate lan guage, called Guzerattee, which is the common written lan guage of tbe Parsees of Bombay as well as of Sunt. For the purposes of general intercourse with tlie natives of India, the civil aud military officers are expected to apply themselves to those tongues most common in the pn cies to which they may be appointed. Hindostanee and Per sian and Arabic are, however, more generally cultivated than others, because the first is more generally spoken, and the are the best written languages, and facilitate the ac quisition of the rest. A person appointed to the Bombay presidency will, of course, acquire Maltratta ami A Bengal officer will find his account in Hindee, Bengalee, and Oordoo. A Madras employe will seek to master Cana rese (often called Malabaree), Tamul, and Teloogoo. In all these languages but the Hindostanee, the assistance of moonshees upon the spot is indispensable ; but Hindostanee may profitably be studied in England. There are several professions available, and Dr. D. Forbes has prepared gram mars and dictionaries, and other elementary works which will materially simplify the acquisition of the language. THE INDIAN PRESS. The first English newspaper published in India, ma appearance in Bengal on the 29th January, 1780. It assumed and long enjoyed a latitude of discussion scarcely paralleled by any part of the English press at the present day. This, however, the government found it necessary to check, and a censorship was established, supported by penal ties, which continued in operation for nearly thirty years. The governing party, who, for a long time, were almost the only European party in the state, dreaded lest the commu nication of too much information* might place a weapon in * Before the parliamentary committee which sat on Mr. Buckingham's claim to compensation for the sacrifice of his newspaper property by the Indian government, curious evidence was given of the nature of the orders issued to the conductor? of papers from time to time during the war with Tippoo Sultaun.

The progress of conquest, however, and the complete annihilation of all European power in India, save that which the English possessed, diminished the fears arising from the general diffusion of news. Accord ingly, in or about the year 1816, the propriety of freeing the press became the subject of frequent debate. But the executive opposed any alteration upon totally new grounds. It was now pretended that our dominion mainly rested upon the respect in which the government was held, and that that respect, according to the authorities of the time, could only be maintained by adding a tender regard for the infirmities of pubhc men to the pompous displays which the revenues were employed to keep up. Regulations were therefore made, protecting from public comment the acts of bishops, judges, governors, eommanders-in-chief, and numerous other functionaries ; and by way of extending the shield of pro tection over the whole fry of employes, a clause was ingeni ously introduced by some governments, prohibiting all dis cussions which were calculated to interfere with the harmony of society ! \u2014 a comprehensive term, the purport of which was not misunderstood. Under the operation of these re strictions, the press of India was for a long time a mere receptacle for advertisements, innocent extracts from English papers (in which police reports and trials for crim. con. enjoyed a marked preference over political disquisitions), shipping arrivals, details of balls, fetes, and reviews, criti cisms on amateur theatricals, the government gazettes, and occasional letters deprecating some small local nuisance. About the year 1820, however, the papers began to wear a new aspect. The legitimate purposes of a public press were first asserted, it is believed, by Mr. Buckingham ; and influ enced by his example \u2014 though not approaching him in bold ness of tone \u2014 the Calcutta press began to question the wis dom of some of the acts of government, and the immaculacy of sundry of its favoured officei's. The sensation occasioned by this sudden assumption of moral and political power, in a community of whom passive obedience to orders and tacit submission to laws were from habit and necessity the chief characteristics, may be imagined. The Europeans, all at"], [96, "72 FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. once reminded that freedom of opinion was an inali' birthright, hailed Mr. Buckingham as a deliverer; and in the ecstasy of their delight at being liberated from the shackles which bound their tongues and pens, they forgot that there was scarcely one amongst them who might not sooner or later feel the inconvenience of too much publicity. Not quite so regardless of the consequences of this bold emancipation were the elderly gentlemen who held respon sible offices under the government. To them, the operation of the freedom of the press presented itself in its most fear ful colours, and they immediately applied the whole weight of their personal and official influence to a counteraction of the assaults of this formidable hydra. But the Marquis of Hastings, then governor-general, had publicly declared that a good government had nothing to fear from the light ; \u2014 he avowed that he courted or dared investigation into his pub lic acts ; and thus, wlule his bearing gave no countenance to the anxious endeavours of the bureo.ueracie and staff by whom he was surrounded, it animated with fresh courage the spirited Buckingham and his now numerous and intrepid adherents. Mr. Buckingham, and the fate of his efforts to assert the freedom of the press of India, have been so often before the public, that it is needless to recapitulate them here. Suffice to say, that, after two or three years of unexampled success as a journalist, a timid locvt/in tenens of the reins of govern ment deported him to England, and for a time checked the adolescent press. But the darkness that followed was not of long duration. Lord Amherst allowed the editors of his day a tolerable latitude of expression. Lord William Ben tinck, his successor, permitted them, during his seven years' administration, to say or publish anything they pleased, and declared that he considered the press a valuable adjunct of the government ; yet, with singular inconsistency, to the last moment of his rule he clung with unaccountable tenacity to his power of \"coming doum upon the press.\" Sir Charles Metcalfe, who temporarily succeeded Lord William, at once and sans/agon freed the press ; Lord Auckland, the succeed ing governor- general, not only recognised the act of his predecessor (though the Court of Directors gave him, it is said, power to annul it), but, in a variety of ways, promoted"], [97, "73 CHARACTER OF THE PRESS. its prosperity ar\\d enhanced its utility. From that hour (1835) to the present, the Indian press has enjoyed a freedom scarcely surpassed by that in which the press of our native country rejoices. It is difficult to compute the exact circulation of all the papers in India, for the tendency to exaggeration on the part of proprietors is as rife in India as in England ; but it may be safely asserted, that the number of subscribers of the dailies, weeklies, &c, combined, does not exceed 10,000.* The character of these papers, with the exception of those professedly in the interests of religion, is pretty much the same. The editors are for the most part educated and inde- pendent men, who, having no interests but the cause of truth, and the welfare and entertainment of society, to promote, and being perfectly unconnected with the govern- ment, freely express their sentiments upon every public question that may arise. The contents and order of arrange- ment of the papers are tolerably uniform. One-fourth, or rather more, of each journal, is appropriated to advertise- ments ; these are followed by local correspondence, extracts from contemporary publications, the government general orders, announcing appointments, promotions, <fec. acts of the legislative council, &c. Next we have two or three columns devoted to editorial lucubrations upon the topics of the day; and these are succeeded by items of Indian news, or news from China, the Cape of Good Hope, New South Wales, Mauritius, &c, winding up with copious extracts from the English papers. Indeed, such is the avidity with which the Indian exile devours intelligence from his native country, that when an overland packet arrives from England, the editors find it their best policy to exclude almost every thing for two or three days, in order to make room for abundant selections. The public appetite, however, is soon satiated, and the dailies then fall into the old track. Besides the presses whence the newspapers, the weekly, monthly, and annual periodicals issue, there are several in India which limit themselves, almost exclusively, to the printing of books, pamphlets, &c. ; and as they are chiefly directed by experienced Englishmen, they often turn out * Assuming that each paper circulates among five persons, there are 50,000 readers in India."], [98, "74 THE NATIVE PRESS. works equal in their topography, paper, <fcc, to tin b. -. offspring of the London publishers. Of these establishments the Bishop's College Press, at Calcutta, unquestionably stands at the head. It was originally set up for the pur pose of reprinting the Holy Scriptures in the native languages, and other works tending to the enlightenment aud conversion of the Hindoos ; but as these did not occupy the entire time of the printers, an extension of its bn was suggested, and it now prints books and periodicals, pro vided their tendency be not immoral. The native papers constitute a remarkable feature of the Calcutta press. They owe their origin to Mr. Marshman, the son of the celebrated Dr. Marshman, who, some thirty or forty years ago, started the Sumachar Durpun, a weekly paper in the vernacular language. The large support which it immediately received from the natives led to its publica tion in the Bengalee and English languages (each alternate column being a translation of its neighbour) ; and in tho year 1837, the proprietor was encouraged to put it forth three times a week. But in the mean while other native papers had started into existence. Some attacks upon the Hindoos, in the columns of the Durpun, originated the Cowmoody, of which the late Bajah Rammohun Roy was one of the editors. It defended the Hindoos, while it endeavoured to instruct them. But the Rajah was not sufficiently orthodox for his colleagues : he soon began to oppose himself to some of the rites and ceremonies of the Hindoo religion, which, if not actually enjoined by the shasters, or sacred books, had been hallowed by custom. Amongst other usages, he assailed the suttee, or self-immo lation of widows upon the funeral pile. This led to the withdrawal of one of the stanchest of his colloliorate'urs, who immediately established a third paper, the C/tundrika, having for its object that pure conservatism which resists the progress of intelligence, and maintains the worst absur dities and most odious tyrannies in all their time-honoured integrity. The Cowmoody expired on the departure of Rammohun Roy for England. The impulse, however, had been given to the native press, and a multitude of journals were consequently soon ushered into existence, some of them originating with the ex-students of the Hindoo college, who"], [99, "75 ITS CHARACTER. had been imbued with rather extravagant notions of political freedom ; and others springing from the orthodox party, or from sycophants who had learnt that something was to be gained by publicly chanting the praises of sundry rajahs ; or from libellers, who panted for a channel of vituperation ; or from the necessitous, who found, in the circulation of a paper, the means of subsistence and the opportunity of literary distinction. About thirty papers, which sprung into exist ence under such auspices, have since expired, after a brief and unsatisfactory career. Five only are now before the public, circulating, weekly, about 2,000 copies altogether. This is, indeed, but a veiy small drop of civilization in the vast ocean of ignorance and superstition, but it is idle to suppose that it is altogether without its beneficial effects. From the extreme parsimony of the natives, it may be con jectured that all these papers are subscribed for by clubs, and that, consequently, the 2,000 copies have, on an average, 20,000 readers. To inoculate this number with habits of reflection, to draw their attention to higher objects than the accumulation of money, the indulgence in sensual pleasures, or the study of the superstitions and ceremonials of a mis guiding religion, is something gained to the cause of humanity. The character of the native press, setting aside the heats and personalities of controversy, is creditable to its conductors. There is an evident anxiety on the part of each journalist to render service to the cause of good govern ment. The honest, and active, and philanthropic civil functionary receives his due meed of praise, while the iniquities of the unjust steward, and his crowd of corrupt omlah,* are boldly exposed and animadverted upon in the strongest terms permitted by the law of libel. That more of the purposes of a press are not fulfilled by the native editors, is owing principally to the poverty of the young men who have embarked in the journalist's profession. Thers can be no doubt, however, that, in process of time, the wealthier classes will become alive to the great impor tance of supporting the press ; and we 'shall find large capitalists yielding the means of establishing correspondence with all the districts in India, of translating large propor- * The native officers of the courts of law and revenue."], [100, "76 SELECTION OF SHIPS. tions of the best English journals for transference to the columns of the native papers, and of maintaining tbe in tegrity aud independence ofthe editors. There are a considerable number of native presses extant, which are limited to the printing of almanacs, books, cata logues, handbills, ifcc. Of these no particular account is necessary. There are also several lithographic presses, one of which belongs to the government, and is used to multiply copies of official correspondence, maps, &c. The others .ire private property, and are kept in constant employ. The native papers at Madras and Bombay are very few in number, and insignificant in circulation and influence. SECTION III. THE ROUTES TO INDIA \u2014EQUIPMENTS TRAVELLING IN INDIA PREPARATIONS FOR THE OUTWARD VOYAGE IN A SAILING VESSEL, VIA THE CAPE. As a person unacquainted with Indian shipping, that is to say, with the vessels which habitually sail between Eng land and India,'will have considerable difficulty in making a good selection, and may, moreover, be too much occupied with bidding farewell to friends, to be able to spare time for the superintendence of all the details connected with the embarkation of baggage, fitting-up a cabin, <fec, it is advis able that he should at once betake himself to an East-India agent's house. This proceeding will save him a world of trouble. The agents are often personally acquainted, not only with the qualities of each desirable vessel, but with the characters, tempers, and savoir faire of their respective commanders. We would, however, earnestly recommend passengers desirous of quiet and comfort, to give injunction'-. to the agent to select a cabin on the lower deck of a ship ; for though not so light and airy as the upper cabins, especi ally in bad weather, there is no disturbance from the continual walking and shuffling over-head, the dropping coils of rope, &c. ; and, besides, the cost of the lower cabins"], [101, "EQUIPMENT FOR A VOYAGE. 77 is somewhat less. On the homeward voyage the upper cabins are preferable in every way, as the vessels are then deeply laden, and it is scarcely safe to open the port-holes of the lower deck for the admission of air aud light. The passage being engaged, and the average price, eighty pounds,* duly paid, the next object which engages attention is the purchase of cabin furniture and the outfit. In the selection of these, the passenger will be prudent always to keep in mind the possibility of converting them to useful pur poses in India. Thus, a sofa, with drawers beneath it, is preferable to a swing-cot, because it can be rendered service able in a house, whereas the uses of the latter terminate with the voyage. But, perhaps, the following list, applicable to almost any condition of life, will sufficiently indicate the ab solute necessities of the traveller. We will merely premise, that it will be good economy to require of the agent that the cabin furniture and fittings-up shall be procured of the up holsterers at the East-India Docks, in preference to any of the professional outfitters : \u2014 A sofa, with mattress, pillow, and a chintz covering for the day-time ; a folding-chair or camp-stool ; a wash-hand stand complete, with ewer, basin, soap-dish, &c. ; a hanging lamp ; a looking-glass, with sliding cover ; a swing-tray ; a chest of drawers, in two pieces, the upper part having a ledge around the top, for the purpose of holding a small collection of books, or preventing articles from falling off; a foul clothes bag (a cylindrical cane basket is better, but it generally occupies too much room in a side-cabin) ; an oil-cloth, or carpet, for the cabin (this is merely for the Bake of appearances. The bare deck is cleaner, cooler, and offers a firmer footing when the ship is rolling or pitching). Equipment of a single man for 1 00 days, something above the computed duration of a voyage : \u2014 Eight dozen shirts ; three dozen night ditto ; ten pairs of sheets (size of the sofa) ; one dozen pillow-cases ; one blanket ; one counter pane ; six dozen towels ; three dozen silk pocket-handkerchiefs ; six pairs of loose cotton drawers, for sleeping or bathing in ; a couple of brown holland blouses ; a blue camlet jacket ; two pairs of merino, camlet, or gambroon trowsers ; two dozen pairs of white jean trowsers ; two dozen white jean jackets ; two dozen white jean waistcoats ; three * A single man in a side-cabin below seldom pays more, though 90?. is generally asked.

These are preferable to a China set, which is liable to break, or to pewter vessels, which soon look dirty, and are not easily cleaned. General instructions to the tradesman from whom the wash-hand stand may be bought, will ensure its being fitted up with every convenience. Tlie foregoing list' embraces the actual necessaries of a bachelor on the voyage to India by a sailing vessel. For pur poses of pastime or study numerous additions may be made, suitable to the means and inclinations of passengers. Fowl ing-pieces, rifles, fishing-tackle, colour-boxes, musical instru ments, books, scientific instruments, telescopes, cards, chess and backgammon boards, are taken, and an outline map of the route, published by Messrs. W. H. Allen & Co., Leadenhall Street, is often added ;* but were it considered expedient to enumerate all the articles that fancy, taste, artificial wants, or peculiar pursuits may suggest, our list might be swelled illimitably. The trunks in which clothes for the voyage may be packed, should depend upon the capacity of the traveller. If he be a military or medical man, and therefore liable to march about the country, bullock-trunks, specially made and sold at the outfitters', are preferable, as they are permanently use ful. But for persons in the civil service, indigo-planters, merchants, clergymen, &c, the portmanteau or tin box, eigh teen inches square, would answer all purposes. The tin boxes can be carried in India by the banghy-bearers, or running-por ters, who accompany palankeen travellers across the country. Of the money which a passenger may carry with him, * Marking the track and progress of the voyage on this map every day, after the captain has taken his observation amd made it twelve o'clock, is a common and by no means uninstructive amusement."], [103, "79 LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION. sovereigns should always be preferred. Twenty pounds will suffice ; for all beyond that, if any be necessary, a letter of credit had better be taken. Letters of introduction, to which so much importance was once attached, are now of comparatively little account in India. The establishment of hotels and boarding-houses has rendered persons on their first arrival less dependent than they formerly were upon the accommodating spirit of the re sident community. Add to this, the great ease with which people of respectability get acquainted with one another at those places of entertainment, and at other public reunions ; to say nothing of the entree to the government-house, which is promptly accorded to all who are entitled by their rank in the social scale to leave their cards ; and it will be readily understood that even for the purposes of agreeable intercourse no introductions are essential. Those who imagine that letters of recommendation will tend to their professional advance ment, form an erroneous estimate of their utility. Neither governors, judges, nor commanders-in-chief, are much in the habit of paying attention to the particular requests of absent friends, unless the latter are very anxious to see their pro teges put forward, and have the means of reciprocating tlie civility of the authorities abroad. A prime minister, perhaps, would not ask a favour of a governor in vain : nor would a wealthy merchant in the city be likely to have his injunctions disregarded by his own agent. In the above instructions regard has only been had to the wants of a single man proceeding to India. To a certain extent the same suggestions will apply to the other sex, for there can be little variety in cabin furniture and the principal accessories to the toilette ; but in regard to costume, distinct details are obviously necessary, as there is scarcely anything in the attire of one sex which corresponds with the garments of the other. The following, therefore, may be regarded as a fair and reasonable wardi-obe for a lady, but can be aug mented, if necessary, according to the affluence or wishes of the party : \u2014 Six dozen chemises ; four dozen night ditto ; four dozen pairs of drawers ; four dozen pairs of thin cotton stockings ; two dozen, &c. of silk stockings ; eight flannel petticoats ; three pairs of stays ; six white dressing-gowns ; six coloured ditto ; two dozen night-caps ; five"], [104, "80 THE SCREW STEAMERS. dozen pocket-handkerchiefs ; one dozen of net neckerchiefs ; four dozen of towels; six pairs of black silk stockings; four | morning dresses, worn at breakfast; a black silk dress nt dinner ; a slight coloured silk, or any cheap material, for dress on Sundays (as these dresses generally become unfit for wear after the voyage, the less cost in the purchase the better) ; black silk or cotton petticoat for every day's wear ; an ordinary cloak, and common straw bonnet, to wear on deck ; shoes and dressing slippers : small silk neckerchiefs ; collars, caps, gloves, and mittens, according to taste ; quilling-net and piece net ; ribbons of low price and different colours ; hair powder ; pi..-, of various si zes ; needles, buttons, hooks and eyes, tape and bodkins, cotton-reels, scissors ; a good supply of papilloie paper ; Windsor soap and wax-candles, pomatum, smelling-bottle, hartshorn, aromatic vinegar, aperients, and a case of Cologne water ; a dressing-case and writing desk, both properly furnished. The pastimes and employments of ladies depend so much upon taste, that it is impossible to offer any but general hints regarding the implements of entertainment most suit.;1 the leisure of a voyage. Knitting and netting,* carpet and crochet work, drawing, books, and music, constitute the ordi nary occupations, which, however, may be varied ad libitum. Musical practice will much depend upon the presence of a piano-forte. If there be not one in the vessel, belonging to the captain, we do not recommend a female passenger to allow of her own, supposing her to possess one, being unpacked for cabin use. The damp sea air and the motion of the vessel are calculated to seriously damage the delicate machinery of a Broad wood or Zeitte, even though it be clamped and fast ened and clothed, to suit the climate of the tropics. The foregoing suggestions apply to persons proceeding round the Cape by sailing vessels. Should they prefer going to India in one of the screw-steamers, which now take the same route, they will only require the same amount of equip ment as the passenger by the Overland Route. The screw steamers leave Southampton, for Calcutta, on the 13th of each month, and reach the latter place, after stopping at se veral places (including the Cape, Mauritius, Ceylon, and Madras) en route, in sixty days.

The prospect of an imprisonment on board a ship for three or four months, with no more agreeable view, externally, than a vast expanse of sea and sky, is to many minds perfectly appalling. Those who have been accustomed to much con finement in town or country, from the nature of their busi ness or the inclemency of the season, have still found time pass lightly in the midst of profitable occupation, the com panionship of books, or the centre of a happy family circle ; but in the narrow limits of a trading vessel, cast amongst strangers, deprived of the necessity for labour, and oppressed with the painful feelings attending a separation from home and valued friends and relatives, they anticipate a wearisome and monotonous existence. The picture which fancy draws is, however, found, on close inspection, to be much less charged with gloomy objects than it appears to be in the distance. The excitement and bustle ever attendant upon the business of a ship, the common interest and sympathy which draw people together who, otherwise, would maintain towards each other the characteristic reserve of Englishmen, the evanes cent nature of the griefs which assail the youth of both sexes at tlie commencement of a career replete with hope and no velty, rapidly create a favourable change in the views of the outward-bound, and prepare the mind for a cheerful endu rance of the inconvenience of a protracted voyage. Few, indeed, are the men and women, who in their after-life do not look back upon the voyage to India as one of the greenest spots in memory's waste. For the devotee of science, there is perpetual entertainment in tracing the progress of the vessel, in observing the practical use of the compass, in Q"], [106, "82 PLEASURES OF THE VOYAGE. taking lunar and solar observations, marking the changes of climate, the phenomena of tbe sea's phosphorescence, the uses of the complex machinery of a ship, <tc. The sportsman will find ample employment for his gun when the gigantic albatross and the sportive Cape pigeon career around and about the vessel in search of prey ; and the fish-hook and the harpoon may not unprofi tably be brought into requisition to snare the monster shark or slay the brilliant dolphin. He who is neither a votary of science nor of sport will resort to books, cards, music, and the various games which e> ingenuity and produce gentle excitement. These will plea santly while away many hours of the day ; and a walk on the quarter-deck, or a merry polka, when the presence of a band and of a sufficient number of lady passengers admits of such an enjoyment, will often consume a long evening in tlie tropics, and stimulate health while they promote good fellow ship. Meals, on board ship, are also more a matter of enter tainment than of business, and are prolonged beyond the ordinary duration, because they contribute to the exhaustion of leisure. Then amateur theatricals serve occasionally to diversify existence ; and the accidental rencontre of a vessel homeward bound awakens family recollections and associa tions, and sends the passenger to his writing-desk to report progress, and proclaim all's well. It sometimes happens that either from previous arrangements, connected with the land ing of passengers and cargo, or with the embarkation of fresh accessions of both, or from stress of weather, deficiency of water or provisions, the vessel puts into the port of Madeira, the Cape of Good Hope, or any of the islands which stud the route between the Azores (inclusive) and the Indian coast. These are pleasant breaks in the voyage which may be turned to profitable account by an observant traveller, and at all events serve as a brief recreation and an agreeable souvenir for the irreflective. At Cape Town, Cape of Good Hope, there are hotels and boarding-houses, where accommodation may be obtained at the rate of about a guinea a day, includ ing the expense of a carriage to the villages and vintages witliin a few hours' drive of the town. There are no \" lions,\" so to speak, at the Cape. A public library offers the means of whiling away an hour ; and a ramble about the streets, amidst a motley population of Dutch colonists, British officers,"], [107, "83 THE OVERLAND ROUTE. Negroes, and Indians, affords entertainment to the eye un accustomed to diversified costumes and complexions. The ascent of Table Mountain is a feat which some adventurous visitors take pleasure in accomplishing ; and if a fine view of the bay and surrounding country is deemed an object of interest, it is certainly to be obtained by the mere trouble of the ascent. THE OVERLAND PASSAGE TO INDIA. The passage to India, vid the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, has been rendered so facile of late years by the con struction of magnificent steamers, the property of the Oriental and Peninsular Steam Navigation Company, that great numbers of persons give it a preference to the route round the Cape of Good Hope. It has the advantage of being an infinitely more expeditious method of reaching India, and of being less wearisome by reason of the per petual change of scene which it presents between England, passing the coast of Spain and Portugal, Gibraltar, Malta, Egypt, Aden (and if bound to Madras or Calcutta), Ceylon and the continent of India. In point of expense, there is but little difference in the two routes, for what is saved in passage-money vid the Cape, is spent in the additional outfit rendered necessary by the length of the voyage. One hun dred and jive pounds (105?.) is the lowest sum paid for a single berth in a cabin in any of the great steamers to Alex- , andria, for a passage across the desert to Suez in one of the vans, and thence in another magnificent vessel to Calcutta. The same passage to Ceylon costs 951, and to Madras 1001. If the party is proceeding to Bombay, a passage is secured (including the trip over the desert) to Aden, and there a Government steamer is monthly in waiting to proceed directly to Bombay. The cost of this partial voyage is 701. ; and 30/. more, payable at Aden, is the charge of the Bombay steamers for the remaining portion of the trip. The steamers of the Oriental and Peninsular Company leave Southampton upon the 4th and 20th of each month, and passages may be engaged on application at their office. The passage money includes an excellent table, wines, liquors, servants' fees, and the carriage of three hundred-weight of g 2"], [108, "84 OVERLAND EQUIPMENT. personal baggage. - For personal use on board the steamer, very little baggage is really necessary. Under the n arrangements iu the large steamers of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, there is no occasion for bed or table linen, a sofa, washhaud-stand, looking-glass, boot-hooks, jugs, tumbler, blacking and brushes, writing-desk, or books : all these are provided in the steamers. Take with you only six dozen shirts, three dozen pairs of socks, a couple of brown Holland blouses, two dozen pairs of white pantaloons, a couple of pair of merino or gambroon trousers, six dozen pocket handkerchiefs, two dozen pairs of long drawers, a forage-cap, a straw hat, shoes, slippers, and your razors and tooth-brushes. We say nothing of waistcoats, boots, cloth coats and trousers, cloak or great coat, because the stoek which a man may have with him when he engages his passage will generally suffice ; but it will be prudent to be provided with a mat or rug, a pillow, and a quilted counter pane (or resai), for it is very probable that, when the passen ger gets into a warm climate he will prefer sleeping on deck, and the steamer bedding is not allowed to be used for that purpose. The best packages are, beyond all question, port manteaus and a carpet bag ; for besides being more easily stowable in a cabin (one may generally be kept there), they can bear a good deal of tumbling about in holds and baggage rooms, on camels' backs, and in river-steamers, while the wooden chest or trunk is veiy liable to get knocked to pieces or wetted tluough. Ladies who may proceed by the Southampton steamers, to Alexandria, en route to India, will proportion their equip ment accordingly. If they will go back a few pages to the list of articles suggested for the sea voyage, and divide that list by two, they will arrive at something like a reasonable conclusion as to what may be really necessary for them. Some parties prefer going through France and Italy on their way to India. There is no doubt that the pleasure of the trip is greatly heightened by taking such a route, if the countries have not been visited upon any previous occasion, though it is not unattended by inconvenience. In the event of the adoption of such a route, all the baggage requisite for the sea trip, upon the Red- sea side of the isthmus of Suez, should be sent previously by the Southampton steamer,"], [109, "EXPENSES OF THE VOYAGE. 85 consigned to some reputable house at Alexandria. There is a material difference in the charge for luggage, if it is understood that the Indian half of the journey will be accomphshed in one of the Oriental and Peninsular Steam Navigation Company's vessels. After going through France, if the traveller purposes terminating his land journey at Marseilles, he will find the steamers of the Company leaving on the 10th and 26th of each month for Malta, whither he can proceed to await the Southampton steamer, or go on at once in the French vessel to Alexandria. In the event of a possible detention at either place, and he has his option, we would recommeud his proceeding to Egypt without delay, as the time of detention there may be more profitably spent, though possibly not more agreeably, for an introduction to any respectable parties at Malta insures the visitor much hospitality. Should the outward-bound tra- veller extend his journey to Italy, he may calculate on finding Neapolitan steamers either at Genoa, Leghorn, or Naples, once, or oftener, every ten days, and in one of these he will obtain a quick and comfortable passage to Malta, touching at one or more of the ports in Sicily. The cost of the passage for a single man from Marseilles to Malta is 71. 10s. ; from Naples to Malta about il. ; a French steamer charges IU. more, independently of the table, from Malta to Alexandria ; and the Oriental and Peninsular Company 10/. for the latter trip, or 17/. from Marseilles to Alexandria ; the English vessel supplying a liberal table and wines without further charge. The charges for second-class passengers are considerably lower ; but we assume that all for whom this book is written are not likely to be satisfied with a secondary class of accom- modation. If persons who are on their way to India, having at some previous time seen Italy and France, are now desirous of extending their knowledge of Europe in another direction, it will be competent for them, on paying the whole amount of their passage to India to the Oriental and Peninsular Steam Navigation Company, to proceed free of charge in the Company's Peninsular steamers, to the coast of Spain and Portugal, vjsiting Vigo, Oporto, Lisbon, Cadiz, &c, joining the Alexandria steamer at Gibraltar."], [110, "86 CROSSING THE DESERT. Very little opportunity is presented to a passenger in one of the vessels bound direct to Alexandria, for seeing any thing of the interior of Malta or Gibraltar. The stay at either place seldom exceeds thirteen hours, nor is there much time to inspect the lions of Alexandria and Cairo ; for as the vessel from India has probably arrived at Suez, and awaits the mails and passengers from Europe, the transit from Alexandria by the steamers on the Mahmoudie canal and the Nile, and from Cairo, across the desert in carriages, is accelerated by the agents of the Company. As, however, it may happen that some little detentions will take place, we refer the reader to the \" Overland Companion,\" published by Messrs. W. H. Allen and Co., for full particulars regarding all the places en route. Our baggage having been sent forward to Suez on camels, we prepare to cross the desert. The uninitiated reader will doubtless picture to himself a complete Oriental cortige, such as we find in the illustrations of the works of Buckingham and Burckhardt, turbaned travellers, long strings of camels, rude tents, guards bristling with arms, a flaring sun, drought, privation, a single palm-tree, and the apex of a pyramid in the distance. Ah, nous avons change tout cela ! Thanks to the exertions of the British agents and asso ciations, who make it their business to promote the intercourse with India, there is little difference now between travelling seventy miles over a post-road in England, and going over the same space of ground on the isthmus of Suez. Forty vans, each drawn by four good horses, and driven by an Egyptian jehu, carrying from four to six inside and none out, transport the living contents of two crowded steamers across the arid and desolate plain which divides Cairo from the Red Sea. Some of the vans have arched roofs, like those of common waggons, waterproof and painted green. They are all light, but very strong, and capable of bearing, without damage, the violent collisions with lumps of stone and rock, to which they are exposed in some parts of the road. The passengers sit, omnibus-fashion, at the sides of the vehicles, entering at the back ; an arrangement that is unavoidable, from the height of the wheels (a single pair), which reach half-way up the body of the van. The seats are carpeted, and the whole thing is roomy and commodious. At the"], [111, "87 SUEZ. end of every ten or twelve miles, horses are changed at a sort of road-side inn, erected for the purpose ; at two or three of which the traveller will get a capital dinner, or breakfast, or luncheon, of eggs, mutton-chops, roast pigeons, stewed fowls, potatoes, bread, and good bottled ale, with tea or coffee,. if he prefer them. Midway, at the hotel, there are divans, or sofas, all round the chief apartment, and bed-rooms for ladies and married people. Here, it is as well to sleep for a few hours, for sixteen hours' continual travelling in the vans will be found de, trop by people unaccustomed to great fatigue. From all this it is obvious that the day has gone by for grand desert, or, as they call it, overland preparations. Let the traveller, therefore, shun the tempting advertise ments of outfitters and guide-books. All the urgent recom mendations, that people should provide themselves with camel-saddles, canteens, bottles of water, parasols, braces of pistols, green veils, carpets, &c, are superfluous. Dress yourself lightly for the day, carrying a cloak or great-coat for the night. Put a tooth-brush, a clean shirt, and a couple of dollars into your pocket, and you are completely equipped for the trip. Suez is not very inviting externally, and when you get fairly within its walls you are satisfied that its exterior has not deceived you. Everything, excepting the court-yard of the caravanserai, which does duty for a custom-house, and contains numerous bales of silks, drugs, grain, ifec, denotes poverty and wretchedness. The houses, built of rough-hewn lumps of rocks cemented by mud, or a clay composed of sand, water, and coarse lime, have a dun-coloured exterior, in capital keeping with the dirty faces of the people and the soil on which the town is built. Still there is enough in Suez to interest, at the first view, a traveller who has never before beheld a purely Mahomedan town. The place is thickly inhabited by Arabs, Egyptians, Copts, and a few Turks ; caravans of camels, which have just arrived, laden with merchandise from Cairo, or awaiting recumbent their loads of wealth from the farther East ; mules and donkeys saddled for travellers ; an occasional horse covered with gay trappings ; the long dark bazaar and the lofty minaret ; the veiled and masked female, and the swarthy, bearded male,"], [112, "88 THE RED SEA VOYAGE. present a picture nearly new even to the man who has just left Cairo. A six days' trip from Suez, with fine weather and pleasant breezes, carries you to Aden, and you have now had a good opportunity of judging of the accommodation and capabilities of the steamer. Say, she is one of the finest steamers, of nearly 2,000 tons burthen, with engines of 500-horse power. She iias a magnificent saloon, or cuddy, where 100 persons can dine with comfort in cool weather. The cabins are numerous, and in each of these are two berths and a horse hair sofa (convertible into a third berth), a wash-hand a mirror, and a pair of boot-hooks. When one person has a cabin to himself, it is only very disagreeably warm and con fined ; but when two are located in the same closet, it is unspeakably hot and inconvenient ; and when there are three \"cribbed and confined\" in the same endroil, it is \u2014 but the thing may be conceived by persons who have ban accustomed to dwell upon the sufferings of the captives in the Black Hole. There is a shower-bauh and a plunge-bath on the starboard side of the vessel, and you may stand upon the grating near the paddle-boxes and be deluged with buckets of salt-water by an obliging seaman. The two former are the most agreeable methods of performing an ablution, but when you have sixty male fellow-passengers all equally anxious with yourself to dabble and splash in the cool fluid, it is sometimes unavoidably necessary to have recourse to the third process. The larboard side of the steamer, from the end of the cuddy to the gangway, is appropriated to the ladies, who have cabins, baths, and a small saloon to themselves. The library on board is select, and well adapted to the instruction and entertainment of the traveller in Egypt, Syria, India, <fec. And as for the table ! \u2014 I have here transcribed the bill of fare on one single day, and will trouble the greatest gourmet of the City of London Corporation to say ii' he could add anything to the carte : \u2014 Mock turtle soup and bouilli \u2014 boiled legs of mutton \u2014 roast ditto \u2014 jugged hare \u2014 roast capons \u2014 corned pork \u2014 pigeon pies \u2014 roast geese \u2014 stewed breast of mutton and green peas \u2014 boiled and roast turkeys \u2014 ham \u2014 roast shoulder of mutton and onion sauce \u2014 haricot \u2014 boiled capons and"], [113, "89 M_-1C\\. tongues \u2014 stewed ducks and green peas \u2014 roast beef \u2014 curried mutton and chickens \u2014 rice \u2014 potatoes, boiled and baked \u2014 pickles and sauces of every description \u2014 jam puddings \u2014 gooseberry, plum, currant, and cherry tarts \u2014 stewed pippins \u2014 maccaroni and cheese\u2014 rice puddings. A dessert of almonds, raisins, brandy-fruits and preserves, oranges, plaintains, biscuits. At dinner, sherry, claret, champagne, ale, and porter. At dessert, port, madeira, and sherry. \u2014 The wine well iced. The breakfasts on the same scale of liberality. Then there is luncheon, and tea and coffee in the morning while decks are washing, and a fusillade of soda water kept up from nine a.m. until nine p.m. In truth, meals are so numerous, and blended into each other so felicitously, that life on board a Peniusular and Oriental. Company's steamer is one vast monstre refection. It may be added, that abundance of steam-water is allowed the passengers for washing purposes, and the bed-linen, towels, &c, required on board, being found by the Oriental Steam- Navigation Company, there is no occasion to take any with you. Aden presents us with one of those phenomena which the giant \"steam\" is every day and everywhere achieving. Barren rocks, and a few yards of sandy shore, once tenanted only by the sea-gull and the crab, are now covered by cheerful domiciles, and animated by a small but busy and contented population, who live by unloading the fuel-ships, storing and protecting the coal, and embarking it upon the steamers. Upon the shore of a little bay, formed by a small belt of rocks, stands a spacious and commodious building, which serves the purposes of an hotel. Some enterprising Parsees from Bombay started and maintain this establish ment, where the steam-boat traveller will find an excellent and (all things considered) not expensive table and cellar, clean beds, white linen, and excellent attendance. Fire wood and sweet water, being brought from a considerable distance, must necessarily be dear ; but they do not consti tute special items in the bill, unless you indulge in a fresh bath, when four shillings, or two rupees, are payable. Donkeys and their attendant vagabond owners are available by scores, and it is usual to hire one for a ride to the Arab town of Aden, four miles from the anchorage, and inspect"], [114, "90 POPULATION OF ADEN. the scene of many a bloody strife, before our troops estab lished their present footing on the soil of the Ishin; Excellent fish, including oysters, are procurable at Aden. But, indeed, there is no deficiency of any of the necess.i' life. Everything that reasonable men can desire is obtained in abundance from the interior; and, judging from thr mens of grain and vegetables daily brought iu on < backs, there can be no doubt of the richness and fertility of the soil of Arabia. It is singular to see every Arab i about Aden unarmed. On the opposite coast, and on the shores of the Persian Gulf \u2014 nay, from Bussorah to Constan tinople, from Bushire to Tabreez \u2014 you rarely meet a man without his matchlock, his kundjur, or his scimitar, and some times with all three, and a lance and pistols into the bargain ; but here you would fancy that the Moslem had ceased to war with his fellow, for if his hand be against every body, it is at Aden an empty hand ! This restriction upon the use of arms originated with the political agent, apd was no doubt intended as a protection against treachery. There is not, however, much of that to be apprehended now. The people are evidently more than reconciled to British authority, for they flock to Aden in numbers totally unknown during the government of the Sultan. From GOO to 1,000 soids in habited the town before our conquest and occupation : at this moment there are not less than 40,000 living there ! From Aden the steamer goes to Ceylou, en route to Madras and Calcutta. If, however, the traveller is bound to Bombay, he embarks in one of the smaller steamers be longing to the East-India Company, and proceeds to his destination direct. The Bombay steamers are neither so commodious nor so expeditious as those belonging to the Oriental and Peninsular Company, but they are sufficiently comfortable for a short trip, and are seldom crowded with passengers. We now arrive in India ; for a description of the principal places in which, the reader is referred to subsequent pages."], [115, "91 MARCHING IN INDIA. TRAVELLING IN INDIA LAND TRAVELLING. There are but two methods of travelling by land in India, on horseback or in a palankeen. The former method is tedious if only one or two horses be used, and even with relays can only be safely and comfortably prosecuted during the mornings before sunrise, or in the evenings when the sun has much declined ; while the latter enables the traveller to pursue his journey unintermittingly throughout the twenty-four hours. Nevertheless, the horse is very generally used for economy's sake, by officers proceeding to join their regiments, and often from the necessity of accompanying detachments of corps on duty ; and in very short trips it is frequently adopted from choice, especially when the distance can be accomplished with a single halt, if relays of horses are provided by friends. In marching \u2014 as the travelling on horseback by daily stages of twelve, fifteen, or twenty miles is called \u2014 it is customary to send on your servants one march in advance, with tent, bedding, tent-furniture, can teen, &c. &c, so as to give time for your tent to be pitched and your breakfast to be prepared by the time you may reach the ground yourself. In the different villages, no difficulty is experienced in procuring fowls, eggs, milk, rice, and the common vegetables of the country; but everything else, such as tea, coffee, dried or preserved meats, sauces, spices, wine, beer, &c, must be procured at one of the prin cipal towns in sufficient quantities to last a week, or even much longer ; for though these things can be obtained on the route, they are necessarily more expensive, owing to the cost of carriage from the presidency. Food and fodder for your cattle are always available, at prices varying with the character or fertility of the country in which the halt may be made. Having arrived at your ground, and refreshed yourself with a nap or a meal, or both, you may, if the sun be not too powerful, proceed, gun in hand, to a neighbouring jheel or tank (lake or pond), or piece of stubble-land, and shoot for a few hours. Snipe, wild fowl, quail, partridges, and hares, abound (according to the season) in most parts of India, and not unfrequently the sportsman's toil is rewarded with a florican, a jungle-cock, or even a bustard. No par-"], [116, "92 PALANKEEN TRAVELLING. ticular costume, differing from the dress of every-day life in India, is requisite on the march, but it will be prudent to wear a sola topee, or hat composed of the soft pulp of a tree, or a straw hat covered with white cotton cloth or feai and a pair of jack-boots will be serviceable as protecting the legs while riding, and also in wandering in covers or along the edges of swamps or tanks. Should the traveller possess nothing of the sportsman's ardour, he may advantageously spend a little time beyond the walls of his tent, in inspecting the temples, serais, and other works of art in the neighbour hood, or in observing the usages of the people in the sur rounding villages. He must be scrupulously careful, however, of committing any act of aggression, or of violating any of the prejudices of caste or religion ; for though the people are, generally speaking, civil, if not obsequious and timid, they will not scruple to assemble in a body and assault a solitary and unprotected individual, if provoked thereto by an offensive interference with thor usages. Injury done to a cow, the death of a monkey or a peacock, or entrance into a 'temple booted and spurred, are amongst the outrages of which the Hindoo, in different parts of India, is peculiarly intolerant. Travelling by dawk, or post, as the trip in a palankeen is designated, involves more fatigue and expense than the method of moving across the country just described, and is by no means so independent, seeing that all the stop pages must be settled beforehand and adhered to ; but it has the advantage of very superior expedition. Preparatory to setting out on a journey, a palankeen must be purchased, and fitted up so as to enable its tenant to have a few books, his shaving and washing apparatus, a canister of biscuits, a bottle and glass, a drinking-cup, a little additional night clothing \u2014 a few books and his writing materials always at hand. A good strong palankeen may be procured for \\tm than 100 rupees (101.), and can always be disposed of at the end of the journey, if the owner have no further occasion for it. The clothes of the traveller, and such articles as he does not immediately require, are carried in tin boxes, or wicker baskets, called pettarahs, by separate bearers, who run ahead or alongside of the palankeen ; and these pettarahs may be procured in any number at the chief towns and stations at a very slight cost. Of money it will be necessary to carry in silver as much as will be required for the expenses of the"], [117, "93 DAWK ARRANGEMENTS. entire journey, especially if the route lies through different territories ; for the civil officers of the respective presidencies, and the residents (envoys) at native courts, have no pecuniary relations with each other. It will be also advisable to can-y a considerable number of the smaller coins of eight and four annas, as gratuities to boatmen who ferry you across the small nullahs or rivers, and to the palankeen-bearers (called hammals at Bombay), at each stage ; for in many parts of the country these latter people are paid so irregularly, or kept so much in arrears, that their very subsistence depends upon the bounty of the dawk traveller. Eight annas (one shilling) at each stage for the entire set of bearers, is, how- ever, as much as is ever expected in the way of bonus. When the traveller is prepared to set out, his first business is to write to the postmaster-general, stating how many bearers he would like to have (twelve is the usual number, but it is sometimes reduced to eight when no great expedi- tion is requisite), how many banghy-bearers for his pettarahs, where he proposes to stop, and for how many hours. The postmaster then writes to the different villages and post stations, ordering relays to be pasted at the appointed hours, and intimates to you the amount to be paid to the limits of the presidency, including a deposit (afterwards refunded), on account of possible demurrage. A mussaul (called in Bengal a mussalchee), or torch-bearer, is added to the number, and his duty is to carry a flambeau during the night. The flam- beau is composed of twisted hemp, fed with oil from a hollow bamboo, likewise carried by the mussaul. A horse dawk \u2014 that is to say, a palankeen on wheels and drawn by horses \u2014 is established along the great trunk road from Calcutta to the Upper Provinces, but it has not become sufficiently general in India to be spoken of here as part of a system. The particulars, as to expense, rate of travelling, <fec, may be ascertained by parties at Calcutta. A letter of introduction will insure the traveller the hos- pitable attentions of any one of the residents ; but failing this, or in case of the necessity or the inclination for a rapid journey, the dawk bungalow affords accommodation. A dawk, or staging bungalow, is a small house standing generally a few yards off the high road, at intervals of about fifteen miles in those parts of the country most frequently traversed, and at greater intervals in less frequented districts. It usually"], [118, "94 RAILWAY TRAVELLING. consists of a thatched or tile-roofed house of one floor, raised a few feet from the ground, and divided into two small rooms, to each of which a bathing-room is attached. A verandah runs round three sides of the building, and there are out-officea for cooking, <fcc. Two servants constantly reside at each bungalow, one acting in the double capacity of khitmutgar, or table servant and cook, and the other as a bearer or mus salchee. While the former prepares such a repast as his farm-yard and private stores will allow, the latter procures jars of cold water, and assists the traveller to perform his toilette. These bungalows are under the control of some government officer at a neighbouring station, and a book is kept in which the visitor (who pays one rupee for the use of a hungalow for any time short of twenty-four hours) records any complaints he may have to make of the attendance of the domestics, the state of the building, &c. RAILWAY TRAVELLING Is a luxury as yet but very partially enjoyed in India. The Bombay, or \" Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company,\" is the only one that has commenced operations. The hne to Tannah (twenty-one miles) was opened in the month of May, 1853 ; and it is believed that before this edition is in the hands of the British pubhc, the road will have been extended to Oallian (thirty-five miles), whence it is to be carried to Shahpoor, on the Tull Ghaut road, eighteen miles beyond Callian. Ultimately, it is intended to bifurcate the line, one portion proceeding in a south-easterly direction, to be united to the Madras line, and the other in a north easterly direction, to form a junction with the East-India Railway, at Allahabad. The Madras Railway has just been commenced. The first sod was turned up in June, 1853. It is intended to con struct fifty miles of rail to Menin, in the first instance, and then to go on to Vaniembady, in the direction of Salem. The East-Indian Railway, now actively in course of con struction, will go from Calcutta to Rajmahal, thence to Allahabad, and ultimately to Lahore,"], [119, "95 THE RIVER COMMERCE. RIVER TRAVELLING. Although several of the rivers in India are navigable for boats of considerable burthen, those alone on which Euro peans are accustomed to travel are the Ganges and its tribu taries (the Hooghly, the Bhauguruttee, the Jumna), and the Indus. Running as does the first through a populous and most important section of the British dominions in India, it connects many of the principal civil and military stations with the seat of the Supreme Government ; while the Indus affords an easy channel of communication between the ex treme point of the north-west possessions and the island of Bombay, passing the provinces and chief towns in Scinde. The traffic on these rivers is immense. By the Ganges the entire produce of Europe, Southern India, the Eastern Ar chipelago, and China, is distributed upwards between Cal cutta, Benares, and Allahabad, and earned from the latter town to the great north-western cities of Lucknow, Agra, Delhi, and the stations of Cawnpore and Meerut, &c, &C. ; while the return boats convey to the capital and the cities on the river's banks, the raw cotton, piece goods, rich stuffs, grain, horses, indigo, sugar, and the thousand smaller com modities and fabrics produced in the interior. The boats on the Indus are freighted, on their voyage from the mouth of the river to the frontier station of Ferozepore, with the com merce of the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, Cutch, Western India, and so much of the products of Europe and of China, procurable in the Bombay market, as are available to Scinde, the Punjaub, and Upper India. The downward cargoes con sist of the produce of the three latter states and provinces, and of Affghanistan and Cashmere. There are two methods of travelling on the Ganges, namely, the flat-bottomed vessels towed by iron steamers, and by pinnaces or budgerows, con structed much after the fashion of the royal or civic barges which float on the Thames, but with the addition of a mast and sails, and sometimes boasting a schooner rig, or the more ambitious equipment of a Lilliputian brig. The rapidity with which the steamer-led flats effect their voyages gives them a preference over the sailing-boat,' a preference which is somewhat strengthened by the attractions of society ; but where great expedition is not a material object, and where it"], [120, "96 THE RIVER FLATS. may he of importance, or a matter of inclination, to visit tlie principal stations on the river-route, or necessary to convey a family and a large quantity of baggage, the budgerow or pinnace should be selected. The flats, or accommodation-boats, consist of sixteen c ranged on either side of the vessel. These are dividi three classes, and cost respectively for the entire trip from Calcutta to Allahabad (at the confluence of the Gang Jumna), 300, 250, and '200 rupees. The charge for the down ward trip is much less, because the course of the stream assists the progress of the vessel and essentially shortens the voyage. Besides the sum paid for the cabin, the passenger is charged three rupees per diem for his table, which CO] of a substantial breakfast, a luncheon, dinner, and tea. All wines, beer, spirituous liquors, &c, are paid for separately, and at rather exorbitant rates. The baggage and furniture requisite for the trip (there is none of the latter to be found in the government boats), must be carried in the cabin ; the remainder is placed below in a species of hold, and is not available until the end of the voyage. The superior cabins, however, are sufficiently spacious to contain all that the tra. veller may require, those of the first class being between twelve and a half feet long, the second nine and a half, and both eight and a half in breadth. The third-class cabins are but sive feet and a half in length, and are consequently only adapted to persons of an inferior grade of life. Every pas senger is allowed to take with him one servant free of cost for his passage ; his diet, if he be a Mussulman, being paid for to the master of the flat, at the rate of four annas (six pence) per diem. Hindoo servants diet themselves, to which end they disembark every evening when the vessel comes to an anchor. The ordinary length of the entire passage of these boats is three weeks. They stop every three or four days at different; stations on the river's banks to take in coal, which is carried in the steam tug only, and deliver and receive pack ages. This affords the passengers a brief opportunity of see ing a httle of the country beyond what can be discerned from the deck of the vessel during the trip. The steam tugs attached to the accommodation or flat boats are of hon, and propelled each by two engines of thirty-horse power ; they are connected with the flat by hawsers and a beam, five-and-"], [121, "97 BUDGEROWS OR PINNACES. twenty feet in length, and a foot in width, which answers the double purpose of a medium of communication between the two vessels at all hours, and a protection from the risk of collision when the steamer happens to ground or to slacken her speed too suddenly. The greater part of these steamers and their attendant flats are the property of the government, at the office of whose superintending officer passages should be en gaged ; but the great demand for conveyance to the interior by vessels of this kind, and the enormous prices charged by the government for freight and passage, has led certain private individuals to place upon the same line steamers which con vey the commercial freight and passengers at a much lower rate and with far greater expedition. The success of the experiment has also induced other parties to form themselves into a company, and invest a large capital in river steamers. Parties who, for the reasons given above, prefer effecting their voyage to their appointed station in a budgerow or pin nace, will do well to address themselves to any of the boat agents in Calcutta, stating the number of persons requiring accommodation (more than three will be inconvenient), the distance to be travelled, the quantity of baggage to be taken. The expense varies with the number of oars required. Two or three officers engaging the largest description of boat will find the cost of the native trip, whithersoever they may be bound, fall short of the boat-allowance granted them by the government. The clubbing together is, therefore, not merely agreeable, as ensuring social intercourse during a long and somewhat wearisome pilgrimage, but commendable as a piece of economy. In addition to the budgerow, a dinghy, or covered native row-boat, is required as an attendant kitchen ; for the culinary process on board the budgerow would be both disagreeable and inconvenient. The furniture of the boat should be of a permanently valu able quality ; that is to say, it should consist of articles con vertible to useful purposes after the voyage has been com pleted. Accordingly, the officer would do well to provide himself with a camp-table, a camp-stool or folding-chair, a charpoy or bedstead, the bottom of which consists of broad tape or sacking, laced and stretched crosswise, and therefore not only less liable to injury than a cane or wooden bottom, but more easily replaced when worn out, and at all times sus- H"], [122, "98 BOAT BCJUIPMENT. ceptible of washing ; a copper basin (called a guindy at Bom bay, and a chillumcbee in Bengal), and folding tripod for its support ; a narrow carpet, or rug ; a hanging lamp (that which he had on board of ship, if he had gone to India in a sailing vessel, will do) ; a canteen, bullock or camel trunks, a cJuiise percfe, and one or two morahs, or stools. All \u25a0 beyond these, in the furniture way, are positive superfluities. Of the articles requisite for the table, the toilet, and the pas time of the voyageur, it is not easy to give general instruc tions, because, beyond the mere necessaries of life, the tity and description of these things will so materially depend upon individual taste and means. A good head-servant, or kliitniutijliiir, will tak*1 care to provide poultry, eggs, milk, rice, spices, and vegetables, as the boat reaches towns and villages on the river's banks ; but everything eta must be procured at the starting-place ; and it should be borne in mind, by persons going upwards from Calcutta, that it is good economy to lay in store for the entire voyage, inasmuch as all articles, the produce of Europe, augment in price in proportion to tho distance from the metropolis whence they are carried. WTines, malt and spirituous liquors, preserves, cheeses, pickles, (fee, sealed meats, hams, tongues, pickles, &c, cost, at Benares, double the price paid at the presi I treble when they are sold at Cawnpore, and so on. The ennui consequent upon the confinement on board a budgerow, during the entire day, makes the possession of certain articles, otherwise luxuries and superfluities, a matter of essential importance to the traveller. Thus, a good double-barrelled fowling-piece will be requisite to ensure a little sport on shore before sunrise and after sunset. Drawing materials will serve to while away a few hours in sketching the scenery on the banks, the costumes of the people, the boats on the river. Books, a chess and backgammon board, and musical in struments, supply endless entertainment ; and it will be no bad plan if the beginner were to apply himself to the study of the language of the country, with the help of Forl\u00bb I Grammar, Dictionary, and the Bagh-o-Behar. The boatmen and native servants do not speak the purest Hindostan the least exceptionable Bengalee ; but there is nothing lost by acquiring a familiarity with a patois, which, in the com mon intercourse of life, is perhaps of more importance than"], [123, "99 TREATMENT OF SERVANTS. the undefiled language taught by the best philologists, and used at courts, and in the transaction of public business. With respect to costume, money, and the attention which it is important to pay to native prejudices and customs, the same remarks hold good as have been offered hi the section of hints for dawk travellers and persons on the march ; it is needless, therefore, to repeat them. One word only : in the treatment of native servants on the river voyages, it is ad visable to combine the greatest strictness with the most per fect forbearance. Look well into the khitmu tghar's accounts ; trust him with no more money than is really wanted at the different halting-places ; insist upon the most deferential and respectful demeanour, neither permitting familiar speech nor a disregard of cleanliness and propriety of costume ; require a correct return every evening of your plate, table-linen, and dusters, and exact payment for every piece of crockery or glass carelessly broken, and every article or other fabric alleged to be lost. The neglect of these matters at the com mencement renders servants dirty, impertinent, and dishonest, and involves more serious loss than would at first thought be conceived. On the other hand, be careful of striking a ser vant for any offence he may commit ; for, in the first place, it is cowardly to raise a hand to one who is incapable of physi cal retort ; and, in the second, it places the offending servant in the advantageous position of a prosecutor for a species of assault which is always severely visited by the Company's courts of law. Another disadvantage attending a resort to the argumentum baculinum is the tolerable certainty of the servant's quitting the boat under cover of the night, leaving the inexperienced traveller perfectly helpless, at a great dis tance from any station where the services of the man can be replaced. You must bear patiently with the offending do mestic on the occasion of misconduct, reserving vengeance for a suitable opportunity of appealing to a local magistrate and of supplying the place of the discarded servant. A voyage up or down the Indus is accomplished, at present, with less comfort and facility than a trip on the Ganges, by reason of the ignorance of the boat-owners of European ideas of comfort, the comparative rarity of the trip, the destitute state of the scattered villages upon either hank, and the freebooting propensities of the people of Scinde and H 2"], [124, "100 BOAT HIRE AND SUPPLIES. the Punjaub. Small steamers ply on the Indus ; but, apart from their occasional detention on the business of the govern ment by whom they are maintained, they are liable to get upon some of the numerous sand-banks with which the river abounds, and to remain there for a considerable time. A resort to the Sutledge boats (when the voyage is to be made downwards) is, therefore, prudent, if not unavoidable. These are long and clumsy, aud are not propelled at a greater rate than one mile an hour, if so much, while the current carries them two miles per hour. A late author, who made the voyage down in one, describes their form as resembling that of a Thames coal-barge. The stern, how ever, is greatly elevated, and the steersman stands thereon working a broad paddle as a rudder, assisted by two men, who use oars. The passenger occupies the entire length of the boat between the stem and the stern, in a rude apart ment made of bamboos and strong grass, thirteen or fourteen feet in length, and rather more than half that space in breadth. The boats cany one mast and a sail, removable at pleasure ; and when the wind is foul, they are tracked along shore by the boatmen ; a usage, by the way, equally common upon the Ganges. The boat hire averages five-and forty rupees per mensem, and it is always made a condition by the owners, that the boat be engaged for a period suffi ciently long to enable her to return to her starting-point : thus, a voyage of a fortnight's duration will cost as much as if it lasted three months ; and if it be engaged down to the sea, it is charged for at the rate of a six mouths' trip. The price paid includes the charge for the crew, and, \"indeed, every expense but the thatching, which costs the traveller twenty rupees in addition.\" In respect to the supplies requisite during the voyage, rather more foresight will be requisite than in the case of a Ganges trip, for, excepting Bhawulpore, Sukker, and Hyderabad, there is not a place on either side of the rivers Sutledge and Indus where anything can be procured. Rice, eggs, flour, oil, milk, and butter, must, in the Sutledge, form part of the traveller's original stock, as they are not to be obtained at the miserable villages of Scinde and the Punjaub. In respect to the furniture of the boats, and the articles generally requisite, the suggestions offered above may be considered entirely applicable, with"], [125, "101 SEA TRAVELLING. this addition, that when on the Sutledge and Indus fire-arms are perhaps useful ; on tbe Ganges they are by no means necessary. TRAVELLING BY SEA. The occasion for this mode of transit from one part of India to another is so rare that it scarcely seems necessary to offer any special advice. It is only when gentlemen are proceeding from port to port on the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, that it becomes essential, in the absence of a steamer, or a sailing free-trader, or country ship, to engage a pattamar, or large sea-going boat. When such are resorted to, the provision to be made will resemble that which has been recommended for the river voyages, though on a much more moderate scale, as the trips along the coast seldom occupy many days. The amount of passage money will materially depend upon the circum stances of the vessel. If the pattamar be already laden with cargo for the coasts, the proportion of accommodation set apart for the passengers will not cost so much as if the boat had been specifically engaged to carry a party from one port to another. Water and fuel are always included in the charge for the passage in either case, but all else must be taken on board. Li proceeding by a sailing vessel or steamer to join a regiment or a civil employment (the only occasion on which duty will call any public servant from, the continent of India), in Burmah, at Mouhnein, Arracan, Penang, Malacca, or Aden, the officer will be furnished with a passage by the government, and this will include cabin, table, <fcc, in the same degree, and after the same manner, as in the case of a voyage from England in a sailing vessel. The sole care of the passenger will be to furnish himself with such articles as may be scarce and dear at the station to which he is ordered, more especially those which are produced in England ; for the prices thereof, always high at the several presidencies, become exorbitant when the charges of further exportation and the profit of the retailer come to be added."], [126, "102 SECTION IV. SOCIETY, SOCIAL HABITS, AND DOMESTIC EXPENDITURE IN INDIA. In the great majority of instances, it happens that those of our countrymen who go to India to seek their fortunes, do so at a period of life too early to have allowed of their seeing much society at home, and consequently with too little experience of it to have formed any judgment that can enable them to compare it with the social system whieh they find established in the land of promise to which they have been led. But to those who do visit India in the maturity of life, and who have been accustomed to move in the good circles of England, the contrast must be striking, and, we apprehend, unfavourable to the Anglo-Indian community. The men and women who chiefly compose the society leav. home in their immaturity. The conditions of the Company's service render this, for the most part, indispensable, as regards their own servants ; and the residents, whose daughters are being educated in the parent country, have a double induce ment for getting them quickly out ; first, the great cost of maintaining them at home, and secondly, the fear that, if they are old when they arrive, there will be \" nobody coming to marry them ;\" and that, consequently, the life-provision which was looked forward to, will have passed beyond their reach for ever and for ever. The men and women of Indian society, then, may be said to leave the home of their fathers as merely boys and girls, green in mind though blooming in person, and almost totally deficient in the knowledge of society, and what constitutes either its conveniences or its charms. Then, there is no such thing in India as a class of persons of easy fortune, who depend not on any kind of daily labour for their bread, and who need only concern themselves in pubhc business as far as it suits their dispo sitions or their fancy so to do, but who have the means of commanding the literary and social agremens of life, and the"], [127, "ENGLISH AND INDIAN SOCIETY. 103 talent to thoroughly appreciate the former mental luxury, and even of adding to the abundance of its supply. But in all that we have said, it must be borne in mind that we are comparing, the Indian presidencies with London, and that they must lose most grievously in the comparison. Rarely revisiting their native land (though the power of steam is gradually obviating that disadvantage), residents in India- necessarily degenerate, in an intellectual sense, aud also in what are regarded as good manners and social habits in England, and their minds and judgments become contracted by a life of monotonous routine, in respect to European subjects of mental cultivation, so that they are at last not only back ward, but bigoted, in many such respects ; and are looked upon, whenever they do revisit their native land, as conceited and ill-informed beyond what they really are. From having long ceased to see and know the best of everything in sciences, arts, and the minor elegancies of life, they come to have an incompetent standard by which to estimate things in these various departments ; and thus the best painter, the best singer, the best actor, the best scholar, the best horseman, the best musician, the best speaker, the best anything, in fact, in India, is taken to be the best of the kind respectively in the world ; and we have known old Indians, by no means deficient in understanding, who, even after a visit to London, could not bring their minds to see the superiority of really superior things, because they had been so long accustomed to meaner criteria of perfection. Another circumstance which prevents the tone of the Anglo-Indian's mind from acquiring strength, or his mind itself from preserving its elasticity, is the humdrum nature of the only society he has. Dine where you will in Calcutta, Madras, or Bombay, you are sure to meet either the same people, or some of the same people, or all in all, the same description of people ; so that your faculties have no new exercise, nothing to polish or to keep them keen ; no new range, or species, of intellect to encounter ; and thus they become either rusted, or stiffened, or worn, by one kind of constant use, into such unwhetstonable bluntness, that they are past all renewing by the time they come into collision with the better-exercised minds of England, and are bewildered, or soured, or stupified, by the too-late discovery."], [128, "104 GAIETY OF THE PRESIDENCIES. Regarding those divertisements of society which are strictly social without being strictly private. Calcutta, at least, is not without its variety. Of these, the re-unions, held during the cold season in the Town Hall, are the first in rank, as being the most exclusive. Subscribers to them must belong to the Government-House list \u2014 a range of ad mission which varies under every new reign \u2014 or be passed hy the \" Committee of Reference,\" which is empowered to decide upon all claims, and which is rigid in its scrutiny. Besides these, there occur in the course of every cold season some events which are deemed important enough to deserve especial celebration. Some locally great personage is going away, or some new governor is arriving, or some dom. political anniversary is coming round, or the bachelors think the ladies should have an entertainment, or something or other there is sure to be, which will serve as a peg to hang a public dinner or a pubhc ball upon. Then there are the races, and concerts, and fancy fairs ; and as these shows are always well attended by the temporary visitors, whose new faces also serve to allure the listless residents of pseudo ton to the same haunts, the city may be said to be a scene of great vivacity and amusement between November and March \u2014 indemnifying people, in some measure, for the lethargic in-door lives they have led during the previous months of caloric, and re-energizing them to again sustain the same in fliction during the season which is approaching. At Bombay, the pastimes of the cold weather nearly correspond with those of Calcutta, excepting that they have an amateur theatre. At Madras, the entertainments, bating the races, and an occasional equestrian circus, are purely private. In India, almost every man is a man of business \u2014 of labo rious daily business, so great, that it amounts almost to a physical miracle how in such a climate the work can be per formed by the natives of other lands \u2014 and he at last becomes so mentally interwoven with his official duty, that he can think of nothing else in the hours when he is disengaged from the drudgery of his desk ; thus, \" the shop\" forms the staple of his social converse, and virtually banishes the su perior orders of intellectual recreation. At the presidencies, there are two distinct classes of society, though each have various intermingling branches ; those are the persons having"], [129, "105 SOCIAL CONVERSE. the right or privilege of pubhc entree to the Government Houses, and those who neither possess the right, nor are allowed the privilege. All persons in the civil and military services of the Queen or East-India Company have the right here mentioned, without any reference to their several ranks or salaries ; and the privilege is more or less extensively dis seminated throughout the principal merchants, the law pro fession, the gentlemen of the Press, the uncovenanted servants, the East Indians, and the natives themselves. This grand line of demarcation, however, has no avowed practical in fluence in the arrangements of the general society ; where individuals constantly meet at private tables, who can never see each other at the Government-House assemblies. Again, the gentlemen of different classes meet on terms of intimacy in cases where the ladies of the higher grade will not mingle with the wives of their husbands' occasional com panions in the lower \u2014 an exception which holds in London as well as in Calcutta, and which necessarily arises out of the intercourse of business. But the \" trail of the serpent,\" which is all over Indian society, is the official hauteur of men who in England would be esteemed as very ordinary persons, but who have the weakness to imagine that the extrinsic circumstance of their being counsellors, secretaries, judges, magistrates, or staff officers, is sufficient to exalt them in the social scale, and to command a deference to which their in trinsic qualities would give them no extraordinary title. But it must be confessed that, even where society is not infested by these important personages, it falls, intellectually, far below the festive or other social re-unions, which render London and continental society in various ways so charming. The labours of the day have wearied the body, and there is no new stimulus to invigorate the mind. The pursuits of the official day are uppermost in all men's minds ; and opium, indigo, or banking ; Government regulations, decrees, or cor respondence ; military orders, appointments, or allowances ; or something or other immediately connected with the poli tical or commercial proceedings of the period, form the heavy staple of after-dinner talk, bringing the honey-heavy dew of slumber on the weary lids of the new arrival, and sending him home convinced or informed of nothing but that the party had been dull, and that the intercourse of tongues had"], [130, "106 ACQUAINT '. not added one grain of wheat to his intellectual granary. Subjects of hght conversation are of great rarity. Exhibi tions, operas, plays, fair debutantes, literary or fashionable gossip, and the encounter of wit which these topics call forth, are nearly all wanting to the Indian community, BW of whom is known to every one in such a degree as to leave nothing tellable about men hi any way locally eminent all do not know already. Yet, with all this characteristic (for, alas ! it is not merely occasional) tlulness and uninstructiveness of social life, it need not appear paradoxical to the reflectin./ reader if we assert, that in no community of like numerical proportion, is a greater amount of general ability, strong sense, and indi vidual cleverness to be found, than exists among the Euro pean gentry of our Eastern capital. Almost every one who comes to India, in the rank of life to which alone our observations are to be understood to soon makes himself at home. If he be an officer in the Queen's or Company's service, his sojourn at the capital will necessarily be brief \u2014 say a month at the utmost, noli regiment be stationed there \u2014 and in that case it would be lost labour to endeavour by a round of visits to establish himself among the permanent residents on terms of equal sociality. He will soon form acquaintances among tli his own class, and will receive the hospitality of the mess in the barracks,* or of some brother sub, who will instruct him in auction and bazaar purchases, horse-flesh, dogs, aud the coarser species of local scandal \u2014 in the \"life,\" iu fact, of that warm-hearted, careless, and practically philosophical of the Anglo-Indian people. If he be of the class who are at once permanently settled at the presidencies, and who are at the same time admissible to the well-defined, yet appa rently confused, circle of society to which we are adverting \u2014 if, for example, he be a member of the bar, and properly in troduced as such, he will make his round of calls (for the stranger, excepting at Bombay, must call on the residents, by way of a beginning) on the principal inhabitants, and will in due course find the civility returned, and that again followed by the formal procedure of an invitation to dinner ; after * At each presidency there is a fortress containing barracks for two or three thousand men."], [131, "107 FURNITURE. which he will naturally fall into a mixed society of his own professional kith, and the less constantly busy, and conse quently more accessible, persons of the various services, the merchants, &c, and may lead \" a very merry, hey-down-derry, sort of life enough,\" and yet one which shall not interrupt his proper pursuits of business. Strictly speaking, there are no \" idlers\" at either Calcutta, Madras, or Bombay, unless it be the few officers who are on leave of absence, and the young writers who are studying the language ! The Indian hospitality, in its olden phase, has almost to tally disappeared, and consequently there are not now any of those sheep and bullock dinners, or hurra khanahs, round wliich from forty to eighty guests assembled, and which cer tainly had an air of grandeur to the unaccustomed eye, and wliich was supported at an expense totally incompatible with the more modern system of bring. Now-a-days, a party of twenty (excepting at a mess) is considered large, and the usual number varies from eight to sixteen \u2014 the medium quantity being, perhaps, the one oftenest collected. The wane of hospitality, which introduced respectable hotels, made at the same time an opening for boarding and lodging houses \u2014 things unheard of even in Calcutta thirty years ago ; while the \" publics\" above mentioned are, as else where, the resort of the occasional visitants, who find good accommodation in them, on reasonable terms, and are thus saved \" a world of woe\" in establishing themselves on their own accounts for the few months, or perhaps weeks, of their oppidan existence. The interiors of the private houses are all so alike, in the arrangement of the rooms, the verandahs, and the portion of furnishing, that he who has seen two or three of the medium size and style will find scarcely any va riety in an inspection of the rest.

The wall-shades, too, may be better (probably not proportionately more numerous), by having drops to them, or"], [132, "108 EUROPEAN HABITS. double branches, and richer chandeliers may aid in illumi nating the rooms of the wealthier inhabitant ; but the way of doing tlie thing is the same in all, and the want of what in England is considered perfect elegance is as observable in the Government-Houses as in the more limited mansion of him whose monthly income (for in India all incomes, whether yearly or otherwise, are paid by the month) may vary from 500 to 1,000 of the Company's rupees. Every person who keeps house has his service of plate \u2014 more or less extensive, according to his station ; but well cleaned plate is a thing not to be met with among high or low. The servants have not the method of imparting to it that brilliancy of polish which causes it in England to add so greatly to the beauty of a dinner-table ; and the same remark is applicable to the glass-ware. So much for an outline sketch of the domestic economy. In regard to apparel, a few remarks will suffice. From March till October, the European clothes himself in a white cotton jacket, like a barber's or a footman's, in the morning, and decorates himself in broad-cloth for the remainder of the twelvemonth. As to the general nature of his other habits, if he reside in town, or at one of the large stations, it is pretty accurately as follows : \u2014 He rises early. \u2014 the lark having no start of him \u2014 and in the cold season proceeds to take a fresh-air gallop, or, if he be a subscriber to a hunt, he \"goes to the dogs\" in that way. In the warm weather, as he must return home soon after the sun is up, he usually undresses, puts on his pajamas (the loose Turkish trouser), drinks iced soda, water, lies down on the couch, novel or newspaper in hand, and in all human probability goes to sleep, in spite of all the cawing of crows (for India is as full of them as a rookery is of rooks), the creaking of wheels, the shrill cry of kites, and the general native bustle ; rises, bathes, and dresses, so as to have breakfast over by ten \u2014 the said meal consisting, at all seasons, of rice, fried fish, eggs, omelette, preserves, tea, coffee, &c, more in the fashion of a Scotch than an English matutinal recreation \u2014 and soon after goes to the counting-house or office, and there labour - duously till four or five o'clock in his vocation, when he returns home and undresses himself, to prepare, by a new course of bathing and toileting, for the evening drive, to see \" the order of the course.\" Every one keeps a horse, \u2014"], [133, "109 CARRIAGES. to be had of all sorts, sizes, and prices, from the pony (fami liarly called tat \u2014 corruption of the native name for the small animal, tattoo), at from thirty up to two hundred rupees, to the horse, par excellence, of which the price varies from the last-mentioned sum up to two, five, and even ten thousand rupees, according to his qualities and the uses for which the purchaser may intend him. Also do all men keep buggies, at tne least \u2014 a buggy being a one-horse vehicle, combining something of the advantages and appearance with but httle of the style, of the Stanhope cabriolet (at Madras they call it a bandy) \u2014 and, in addition to this, a singly blessed merchant, or government official, keeps unto himself a palankeen carriage (called, at Bombay, a shigrampo), which carries him to and from office, and is just a larger (not always even a larger) sort of palankeen, mounted on wheels, and drawn by one horse, or by two horses, instead of being carried upon four men's shoulders. Married persons of even minor condition keep their carriages, which are not thirty pounds per annum more expensive than the buggy, and which are constantly to be had for private sale, or at auctions, horses and all, for from about a hundred and fifty to three hundred pounds. The evening drive has no recom mendation beyond that of passing the most disagreeable hour of the day in inhaling coolish air ; for you meet the same faces, the same equipages, and receive and make the same formal bows, almost every evening, and the mind derives no refreshment, save what goes to it through the body. The drive is succeeded by a languid sort of dinner, and the whole community are asleep before eleven. In England, where business of every kind \u2014 political, commercial, and miscellaneous \u2014 is in so great a measure (as is known to be the case) carried on by means of oral com munications, it will excite surprise to learn how httle is thus transacted in the metropolis of India ; and any mer cantile man arriving there and at once entering upon his vocation, would at first not comprehend the necessity for the apparently time-wasting system which we are going to describe, and which we shall denominate the chit-system. The word chit is a corruption of the Hindee term chit hee (loosely pronounced chitty), which in Enghsh means \" a letter,\" be the same short or long ; for they have no such epistolary distinction there as corresponds with our \" notes,\""], [134, "110 THE CHIT SI ITEM. \" letters,\" <fec, all kinds of letters being indicated by the one common epithet. Throughout the British ea. tories, then, verbal messages, bv servants, are almost totally unknown, and wholly so on matters of any importance ; so that chits are flying about the town all day, and a particular cl servants, called peons, or sepoys, are kept in very cm employment as the bearers of these despatches. Written generally in haste, not commonly on matters of consequence, many having to be written every day, and the bearei- being unable to master their contents, a slovenly habit has been naturally fallen into of despatching them carelessly soldi '. written on scraps of paper, and despatched unwaf ered or un sealed. The system itself is, we apprehend, inevitable, for the climate does not admit of the constant running about of Europeans themselves : their Eurasian clerks cannot go a hundred yards without incurring the cost of a palankeen. The English can rarely speak the native language well enough to enable them to intercommunicate by means of native servants ; and there would be various objections to trusting a native with the purport of such communications even where some of the baboos, sircars, purvoes, and others of that genus, can converse with sufficient comprehensiveness in Enghsh for the purpose. In the cold season, more, of course, is done by personal intercourse than in the housing times of the year ; but even shopping of all kinds is principally carried on by chits, and for borrowing a book, as much as for borrowing a thousand rupees, a chit has to be written, and a chit answer returned, in the event of the loan not accorded. Where a chit requires no answer, or where an affirmative rejoinder needs no explanation (such as where one accepts a friendly invitation to dinner), then the word salaam, sent by the messenger to his master, serves the several purposes of an acknowledgment of, or a receipt for, the chit, and an acquiescence in the request it contained.* We have hitherto been speaking of the gentleman chit affairs ; those of the ladies are the same in principle, but, oh ! how dissimilar in practice !

PIC-NICS. dency has to write, on an average, two thousand chits per annum ; but in theirs is observable none of the slovenliness wliich characterizes the bulk of the masculine dealings in the same industrious line. Another usage, which cannot fail to strike a newly-arrived emigrant with surprise, but which he will find to be in many respects convenient, and scarcely at all perplexing, is the extent and variety of street-traffic which will be forced upon his notice as he lolls in his palankeen. In London, there is a species and degree of this retail trade, to be sure, in the shape of fruit-stalls, stick-exhibitions, oyster-stands, old- book temptations, and wandering Jews \u2014 but they are only tolerated by the municipality ; whereas in Calcutta there is no right of interference with the out-door race, and as regards \" Europe \" articles, they are all perambulatory. Hats, stocks, boots, shoes, books of all descriptions \u2014 new and old, standard and ephemeral, costly and' cheap; prints, boxes of every species of the Geneva writing-desk, tea caddy, and work-box ; jewellery, forest-birds, looking-glasses, toys, guinea-pigs, footstools, dogs, ivory articles, whips of all sorts, fringe-work, shells, pedlary, perfumery \u2014 in a word, almost every portable thing, after its kind, is to be had from the street venders, at rates which seem to baffle all doctrines of production-cost, and as good as the same kind of wares, \u00abfec, can be had in the native shops. As we speak of the sporting amusements of Calcutta elsewhere, we shall in this place only mention one or two of the recreations which belong to the class called pic-nics, and which occasionally break through the business monotony of a Calcutta life. A day at Barrackpore Park, which is a lovely piece of ground, and in which the Government keep up a menagerie and aviary, allows the mind a holiday which it often stands in need of ; and as the settledness of the weather between November and March is uniform, there is a great deal of cordial enjoyment derivable from such excur sions, where the party is well assorted. The party can go by land and return by water, or vice versa, and thus obtain a variation of travel which, in returning especially from these exciting excursions, is well adapted to keep the mind from flagging, or feeling jaded, by its long and unusual state of joyous excitation. In the opposite direction \u2014 to wit, down the river Hooghly \u2014 the Company's Botanic Gardens are a"], [136, "112 HOLIDAY AMUSEMENTS. favourite resort of all classes of the community upon Satur days and Sundays. But what are termed the Doorga Pooja holidays, which usually commence about the middle of September, and last eight or ten days, form the period of time which admits extended excursions of almost all classes of men of bu from the metropolis, and there is as much deadness then in Calcutta as there is in London at or near the same time of the year. The Hindoo natives lay aside all kind of business, save what daily necessity renders it indispensable to pursue, and shops and offices are shut up, or their tradeful hum and bustle all but stagnated, while that great religious ceremonial is in course of being observed. Then the European mer chant, the clerk, the official, the lawyer, the shopkeeper, and artisan, all absent themselves ; some for several days, and some for a few weeks, in the certainty that competition cannot be active while they are gone, and that the general stagnation is such, that httle could be profited by their remaining at their business. Pinnaces and budgerows are then hired for trips into the Mofussil, and the planters residing contiguous to the banks of the river are glad of an opportunity of offering hospitality to those who, in the later period of the cold season, readily open their doors to them when they visit the presidency. The holiday amusements of the residents at Bombay are more limited than those of the inhabitants of Calcutta ; but they are very delightful of their kind. The island of Elephanta, and its curious subterranean temples, the islands of Salsette, Gorabunder, and Bassein, all abounding with picturesque scenery, antiquities, and remains of the Portu guese dominion, are reached in two or three hours' sail, or in a land journey of briefer duration. Livery stable-keepers supply excellent carriages and horses to those who have not cattle of their own ; and beautiful roomy boats, called bunder-boats, are obtainable at the piers, by application over-night. At Madras, the cold weather brings the oppor tunity for rural trips into the interior, where the diversions of shooting and hunting afford the toil-worn man of business a pleasant annual relaxation. The important question of general morals may be justly decided in favour of an Indian residence over a London one,"], [137, "113 DOMESTIC LIFE. as regards a young man just entering into life in search of his own subsistence. In our Oriental cities there are none of those lures and haunts which prove so attractive and fatal to the young Londoner. His Indian contemporary almost must spend his evenings in a decorous manner, for he would soon become marked if he frequented such scenes of de- bauchery as there are, which are of the veiy lowest description, and where common soldiers, sailors, and the absolute black- guards of the place resort. Drinking, too, is a practice not at all encouraged or countenanced in the Anglo-Indian community. On the whole, whatever bugbear-born appre- hension fond parents may entertain of sending their junior offspring to India, on account of fever, liver, cholera, sun- strokes, and Thugs, we may conscientiously assure them, that, whether in the Company's service or the mercantile or miscellaneous line of adventure, their morals are in infinitely less danger of contamination than they are in life in England. Although we shall now lay down a full establishment, such as is kept up by a person of local rank or mercantile affluence at the presidencies, yet our details will be designed for the information and guidance of those who go to India to seek their fortunes, and whose mode of hving must, or in prudence should, be in accordance with their immediate means and near prospects. The few persons who are sent to India at years of discre- tion, and with their fortunes, rank, and stations ready cut out for them \u2014 such as members of council, commanders-in- chief, bishops, judges, law commissioners \u2014 are at no loss about their domestic settlements ; nor will it inchoate their ruin to expend a few rupees more than an accurate calcula- tion of comforts might allow ; whereas if the cadet, the merchant's clerk, or the tradesman were to begin impru- dently, the consequences to them would be the \" bread of sorrow\" in after-days, when reflection, coming too late, could only serve for punishment. Young men who enter the civil service, and cadets, have a fixed and regularly-paid monthly salary from the day of their landing \u2014 the former having Rs. 300 and the latter nearly Rs. 200 per mensem ; with this farther difference, that the former, if a diligent student of the native languages, may in two years, or even less, i"], [138, "114 EXPENSES OF LIFE. acquire a material addition to his original income ; while the latter may, and usually does, remain from six to twelve years in rank and emolument exactly where he started. They who come out in a good mercantile connection are also generally provided for at once, as clerks or assistants ; but the tradesman or mechanic has to rely on the produce of his brow's sweat from the beginning. With reference to the mention of the local coin which the nature of this section will render it necessary for us to make, we may state at once that, although the rupee fluctu: exchangeable value (in remittances to England) from 1\u00bb. lid. to 2s. Id., and is sometimes lower and higher than these two points, respectively ; yet it will give the reader a sufficiently correct estimate of our price-current observations, to consider it, in round numbers, as representing two shillings sterling. This scale will keep him, commercially and arithmetically speaking, very nearly right ; but it will not (and nothing but local experience will) make him accurately acquainted with the great difference in what we may call the moral value of money in England and in India. A rupee is constantly given where even one shilling would be hesitated about by the better homo economist, and is very frequently expended where even a sixpence would serve the turn in England ; but the grounding of the adventurer in this description of uncon veyable knowledge must be the work of experience and ob servation on the spot. Book learning will not assist him. If the \" young gentleman\" get into a Mess, or to chum with an old hand, it will be financially much the better for him at the outset, if he have common sense and ordinary prudence ; but if circumstances so shape his lot that he shall have to keep house for himself, he will then find some benefit from remembering the information we design to supply. We pro ceed to set out a list of the expenses attending an Anglo- Indian establishment upon an entire scale, and shall point out the reductions in it which are applicable to inferior con ditions of white mankind in the East.

At the presidencies, there are houses in great variety, in size, situa tion, and rent-charge, and, of course, in this variety of dwell ing-places, the purse may be suited even at the lowest ebb which will allow its possessor a roof over his unhappy head at all ; but it 4s not easy for any respectably-situated person to procure a tenement which will insure him the lowest degree of comfort, with reference to the skyey influences, for a less rentage than fifty rupees a month ; and such a house will probably be deficient as to convenience of site for any one whose daily business requires his presence in the town. Cer tainly, two, or even more, young men may take a house among them, even if circumstances should not allow of their hving together throughout ; but the adventurer who comes to India in a state of double-blessedness, or who imprudently gets into such a state too soon, financially speaking, after wards will find himself compelled to put up with but sorry I 2"], [140, "116 THE HOUSE SERVANTS. accommodation, compared with what the lowest Calcutta or Madras rent for a decent European \u2014 say thirty rupees a month, or nearly forty pounds per annum \u2014 would obtain for him in most parts of England. Houses, in fact, are very dear at each presidency, the higher class letting, without an atom of furnishing, at from iOOl. to 800Z. per annum, and DO really respectable abode being to be had, in a convenient position, under 2501. or 3001. per annum (paid, like every thing else connected with the \"domicile,\" in rupees, monthly), though without the addition, to tbe renter, of any description of municipal taxes. And now for the menials. The khansama, or butler, acts the part which, in a mode rate English establishment, is acted by the mistress and the cook together ; that is to say, he markets, prepares the pastry and the made dishes, makes preserves, superintends the whole kitchen arrangement, and in general leaves nothing to the cook but the actual cooking. The khansamas are always in telligent, respectful, and well-mannered men \u2014 Mussulmans, or Parsees \u2014 and have much influence in the house, being treated very familiarly (within perfectly becoming bounds) by their masters and mistresses, of whose interests they are usually watchful against all depredators but themselves. The khidmutgar, or boy, is of the khansama genus, and often assumes the title, where no regular one is kept. His own business, however, is (in a full establishment) solely to lay the table, bring up the dinner, and wait during the meal. A couple \"well to do\" would probably keep three or four of these menials, and more than that if the domestic quiver were full, for the children of such magnates have servants of their own. General honesty, amid much temptation and many facilities for a lapse from virtue, cannot but be con ceded to them ; for they have constant access to the plate, wines, tea, table linen, and similar valuables, and might de camp with various spoons under all reasonable chances of impunity, as the police is rather inferior to that of Paris when Fouche had its management. The khidmutgar is a clean and smart-looking servant, not at all mal-adroit in the practice of waiting. Small people, if bachelors, are for the most part content with one khidmutgar, and dream not of a khansama ; but whether there be one or half a dozen, the breakfast and dinner table exhibits the same fanciful"], [141, "117 THE HOUSE SERVANTS. neatness of arrangement. All the spoons in the house are displayed in the centre of the table, in various tasteful ways, and are interspersed with wine-glasses, flowers, silver forks, &c, while in the midst rises the butter-pot \u2014 of cut glass or silver, as the case may be \u2014 in which the butter appears like a piece of beautiful carved work, and, with the appliance of sparkling ice, is really tempting to behold. Indeed, the khidmutgar contrives to lay out a very enchanting breakfast with sufficiently simple means. The snowy whiteness of the daily-clean cloth, the green chillies floating in the rlean water of the half-filled wine-glass, the eye-refreshing mustard and cress, the silver (which might be hrighter), the pots or glass ware recipients of various preserves, and lastly, the substan tial \u2014 the omelette, the rice, the fish, the muffins, the chitnee, the cold meats, and the fresh and fragrant tea \u2014 all have a tendency to create an appetite beneath the ribs of death, and to render gaunt famine, or penurious scarcity, quite impos sible visitants. Next in descent to the above-described \"obedient humble servant\" comes the musalchee (at Bombay called a mussal), who is like unto the scullion in British households. The analogy between the musalchee and the scullion, indeed, is not complete in all its parts ; for the former cleans knives, plates, spoons, glasses, <fcc, and does, in a word, the under work of the butler's pantry, which is somewhat above the performances of the nymph of the scullery. The cook, or bawurchee, called bobberjee by the Enghsh, who are the vilest corrupters on earth of both foreign lan guages and their own, is in a rank by himself, and composed of himself solely, unless he has a mate (not meaning a wife), as in large houses he has. To the establishments of the smaller orders he is not essential, for the khidmutgar and musalchee will there manage that business very creditably between them ; and where he is kept, he is paid according to his excellence. Leaving the culinary precincts, let us proceed into the body of the house, and there we meet, at Calcutta at least, with the dignitary called the sirdar, or chief of the bearers. The sirdar-bearer, called sirdar in brevity, is, among other things, the valet-de-chambre. He prepares the evening lights, a duty which naturally involves the furbishment of the candle-"], [142, "118 OUTDOOR SERVANTS. sticks, glass shades, and snuffers, and which, at Bombay, is performed by the mussal, and at Madras by the matee. He also polishes the shoes, boots, straps, and so forth, of his mas ter. Moreover, he rubs tables into brightness, with cocoa-nut shell and wax-cloth, makes the beds (for housemaids are things unknown), and performs a variety of little nameless items, which need not to be enumerated. Among the upper classes (the upper in point of salary we mean), there are four or six palankeen-bearers retained, be sides the sirdar and mate ; but the two latter are to be found in almost every house, and may be considered indispensable. The bheesty (properly bihishtee) provides the water for the use of tbe whole establishment ; hanging a sheepskin on his recreant hip, and carrying it along with apparent awkward ness, though with real ease. The duty, at Bombay, devolves on a puckalee, who carries the water in copper vessels, attached to a bamboo slung across the shoulders. The mihtur is the pariah of the establishment, and is wise enough to eat of the crumbs (a phrase including every good thing) which fall from his master's table. He sweeps the house, cleans out the bathing-room, and does all the dirty work, in fact, as well as takes care of a dog or two, if necessary. The dhobee, or washerman, is fully explained to the English reader by his English name, though he differs in some respects from the English washerwoman, as well as in being of a different sex. For instance, while she is np to her elbows in a wash-tub, he is up to' his knees in a tank, or may be in a river ; while she rubs her knuckles into a shrivelled and blistery-looking skin, he bangs the linen raiment of master, mistress, and child, against a serrated log, or a roughened stone ; while she is all suds, the frothy article is scarcely known to him, and yet he is well off for soap, but the modus operandi is unfavourable for the accumu lation of the frothy pile ; while she mangles, he is ironing, with an enormous brazen iron, of which the weight has an effect equivalent to mangling, on the cloth ; and finally, while she brings home her linen as yellow as saffron, he brings his home as white as snow. The dhobee of a bachelor gi pay opposite to his name in the foregoing list ; but where"], [143, "119 OUTDOOR SERVANTS. there is a lady in the case, his wages are at least doubled, and increased also by a rupee or two for every child. The durzee, or tailor, is an indispensable adjunct, his business being to mend the clothes as fast as the dhobee tears them, and for this purpose, chiefly, he works daily, from nine o'clock till five, at the presidency, but from sunrise till sunset in the upper provinces. A lady's tailor gets from eight to ten rupees per month, and has no very quiet life of it ; but the scolding is systematic, and he cares little about the matter. But the bachelor's tailor hath a life of ease and pleasure, working half the time for the servants, who pay him for that same. The peon, chuprassy, peada, sepoy, or messenger, carries letters, runs by palankeens, stands behind carriages, and is altogether a functionary of consequence. When forming part of the official establishment of a civil servant, he is feared, hated, and outwardly reverenced, by the natives of the district \u2014 for then he acts as bailiff, process-server, and all manner of hateful things ; and invariably turns his power into a source of unlawful profit, from exactions and general corruption. The syce, or groom, does what his translated name denotes, but in a way very different from his English namesake. Smart and vigorous grooming is unknown in India, and, judging from the fair condition of the horses, would not appear to be needed. He, moreover, runs behind the horse, or vehicle, as the case may be ; and will keep up with the latter for miles, without any apparent effort, as also with a horse going at an easy canter. He is a good and generally trustworthy servant. The grasscutter is, nowadays, more a mofussil appendage than a presidency one ; for in the latter place, grass or hay is purchasable ; whereas in the former regions the grass has to be daily rooted up for the horses, and this labour is, in the dry and hot months, especially severe. The coachman is sufficiently expert for his vocation in the East, where crowds of carriages are almost unknown, and where all cart-drivers, &c, are forced to get out of the way. He has no great delicacy of ret?!, touch, and not the smallest pride in his harness or other appointments, which, if the"], [144, "120 FEMALE SERVANTS. master chooses, will go dim and dirty enough. Indeed, the best Anglo-Indian turn-out is but a poor affair compared to the second-best London one. The abdar (literally \" keeper of the water\") is he who used to cool the wines, water, &c, with saltpetre, before the enterprise of the Americans afforded the delightful luxury of ice. The abdar now manages the ice, but it is only in wealthy establishments that such a servant is retained, aa the kliidmutgar and sirdar-bearer, between them, can manage well enough. The hookah-burdar is a domestic fast going out, in conse quence of the supersession of the hookah by the cigar. The ayah, or lady's maid, has no innate taste for dressing, but can usually plait hair well, and contrives to fasten a hook, and to stick in a pin so that it shall soon come out again. She is often the wife of one of the khidmutgars, and then the double wages make the service valuable to the worthy couple. Frequently, she is an Indo-Portuguese woman, and though a sad and ugly drab, is in most respects superior to the Mussulman women. The mithuranee is usually the sweeper's wife, is more intelligent than the ayah, and does the slop-woik of \" my lady's chamber ;\" but is often, where there are no children, the only female on the establishment ; in which case her wages are raised a rupee or so, and the arrangement answers very well. Where children are, then the women of both classes are multiplied in a concatenation accordingly. The sircar, bahoo, purvoe, or whatever he may be called, is the chancellor of the exchequer, and it is not unseldom (in the olden time it was always the case) that his master is his debtor \u2014 and then the mastership is but a vox. They are a shrewd, intelligent race, of most respectable appearance and demeanour, talk English, and manage everything for you easily and delightfully. They are almost always honest, in the sense of never absconding with your money, even where they give no security ; because their great profit is made by commissions and small surcharges upon everything you buy, aud dustooree, or custom (per-centage, taken from the native seller), upon every payment you have to make. All men in business have sircars, but a mere private family, such as that of a military man, for example, seldom retains and does not"], [145, "121 GOVERNMENTAL DIVISIONS. require them. They are a strange compound of easiness and strictness, usuriousness and liberality, honesty and fraudu lence, patience and importunity. Such is an Indian household ; a motley assemblage, and yet harmoniously enough conducted. Hindoo and Mussulman pull well together, and where good service is not done, it is oftener the fault of the employers than the employed. SECTION V. THE GOVERNMENTAL DIVISIONS OF INDIA. To facilitate the operations of government, the whole of the country is separated into four great divisions, namely : \u2014 -the presidency of Bengal, the presidency of Madras, the presidency of Bombay, and the north-western provinces. The presidency of Bengal is ruled by \"the supreme government of India,\" consisting of \u2014 A Governor-General, and President of the Council ; Two members of the Council, drawn from the Civil Service ; One member from the Military Service ; One Military member, who is likewise Commander-in-Chief of the army of India, and especially of the troops of the royal service, to which he invariably belongs ; One Ordinary member who is not in any particular service, and generally selected for his legal attainments ; A Lieutenant-Governor for the administration of the affairs of Bengal Proper ; A due proportion of Secretaries and Assistants, and a Legislative Council. The presidency of Bengal is divided into sixteen provinces, in seven of which (having been for some time under British rule) certain regulations prevail which have no operation in the districts which have only become part of the British dominions of late years. These former are called regulation districts : they are comprised in the Jessore, Bhaugulpore, Cuttack, Moorshedabad, Dacca, Patna, and Chittagong divisions, and contain a population of 36,848,981 persons."], [146, "122 MADRAS AND BOMBAY PRESIDENCIES. The non-regulation provinces include Saugor and Nerbudda, the Cis-Sutledge districts, the Assam or north-eastern frontier, Gowalpore, Arracan, Tenasserim, the south-west frontier provinces, the Punjaub and the Sunderbund. Of these the total population is no fewer than 11,109,339 ; and the whole of the provinces, regulation and non-regulation, cover 325,652 square miles. In addition to these provinces, the authority of the Bengal government extends, to a certain degree, over the native states of Hyderabad in the Deccan, belonging to the court of the Nizam ; of Oude, Nepaul, Nagpore, fc-cindiab's dominions, Indore, Bhopul, Rajpootana, Rohilcund ; various petty hill states ; chieftains in the Cis-Sutledge provinces ; in the south-west frontier, Sikkim, Bhawulpore, Kashmere, Munnipore, Tipperah, the Cuttack Mehals, &c. These states cover 583,404 square miles, and have a population of 43 millions and upwards. The presidency of Madras is governed by \u2014 A Governor, and President of the Council ; Two Civil members of the Council ; A Commander-in-Chief, who is likewise a member of the Council ; For revenue purposes, the territory is divided into twenty one divisions or collectorates, of which eighteen are under the regulations, viz : \u2014 Rajahmundry, Masulipatam, Guntoor, Nellore, Madras, Chingleput, Arcot, north and south Bellary, Cuddapah, Salem, Coimbatore, Trichinopoly, Tanjore, Madura, Tinnevelly, Malabar, and Canara. The area of these divisions comprehends 119,946 square miles, with a population of 14,612,296 persons. The three non-regulation provinces, Ganjam, Vizagapatam, and Kurnoul, contain an area of 3,243 square miles, with a population of 241,632. The native states subordinate to the Madras government, are Cochin, Mysore, Travancore, and Vizagapatam, covering 50,637 square miles, with a population of 4,691,230. The Bombay presidency is under the government of \u2014 A Governor and President of the Council ; Two Civil members of the Council ; A Commander-in-Chief, who is at the same time a member of the Council. In the Bombay presidency are thirteen regulation, and"], [147, "123 NORTH-WEST PROVINCES. three non-regulation provinces : \u2014 Surat, Broach, Ahmedabad, Kaira, Candeish, Tannah, Poonah, Ahmednuggur, Sholapore, Belgaum, Dharwar, Rutnagherry, and Bombay Island, constitute the regulation collectorates ; Scinde, Sattarah, and Angria's Colaba, comprise the non-regulation divisions. The former contain a population of 8,151,049 souls over an area of 57,405 square miles ; the latter have a population of 2,333,968, and an area of 62,660 square miles. The native states subordinate to the Bombay government are Baroda, the Guicowar's dominions, Katty war, Pahlumpore, Cambay, Ballasinore, Dhurumpore, Baroda and Suckeen, the Daung Rajahs, Peirt and Hursool, Kolapore, Sawunt Warree, Maheecaunta, and other petty states in the neighbourhood ; Cutch, Akulkote, certain states in the Sattarah dominions, and numerous jaghiredars in the Southern Mahratta country. These states are embraced in an area of 56,320 square miles, and contain 4,613,225 souls. The north-western regulation provinces, subject to the jurisdiction of a Lieutenant-Governor, comprise Delhi, Meerut, Rohilcund, Agra, .Allahabad, and Benares, the area of which is 71,972 square miles, with a population of 23,199,668. The non-regulation provinces embrace the Bhattee country, including Wuttoo, the pergunnah of Kole Kasim province, the Jaunsor and Bawar province, the Dehrah Dhoon province, Kumaon (including Ghurwal) province, Ajmere province, and British Nimour province. The area covered by these is 13,599 square miles, and the population exceeds 600,000. The Eastern Straits' settlements, managed by resident Councillors, are Penang province, Wellesley, Singapore, and Malacca. The total population of these settlements is 202,540 ; their superficies in square miles 1,575. The Foreign settlements in India are reduced to those of the French and the Portuguese. The French consist of Pondicherry, Carical, Yanaon, Mahe, and Chandernagore ; the Portuguese only hold Goa, and the islands of Damaun and Diu."], [148, "124 SECTION VI. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL PLACES IN INDIA. THE PRESIDENCY OF BENGAL. Calcutta \u2014 Berhampore \u2014 Monghyr \u2014 Patna \u2014 Benares \u2014 Mirzapore \u2014 Allahabad \u2014 Agra \u2014 Cawnpore \u2014 Lucknow \u2014 Delhi \u2014 Meerut \u2014 Landour \u2014 Almorah, &c. For greater convenience of reference, we will take each presidency separately, commencing with Bengal, as the most important, and following the river route to begin with \u2014 Calcutta. \u2014 The first view of Bengal-India gives the longing voyager a dreary pang of disappointment, owing to the low, ugly, and inhospitable shores of Saugor Island, at the entrance to the Hooghly, with scarcely a sign of cheering civilization, or any tokens of a thickly-populated land. This desolate appearance, and the corresponding sensation which it excites in the stranger's breast, arise from tho peculiar circumstance of there being no town at the mouth of the river, nor any mark of one as far as the eye can reach. Sail on, however, in the true hope which should always sustain adventurous spirits, and you will be richly rewarded for your primary disappointment. Viewed from the magni- ficent bend of the river, denominated Garden Reach, where the town first opens on the approaching vessel, the coup <T\u0153il is one of various and enchanting beauty. Houses like palaces are studding the bank on the proper left of the river, and a verdure hke that of an eternal summer renovates the eye, so long accustomed to the glitter of the ocean. Anon, on your left, appears the semi-gothic Bishop's College ; and in front of you, every moment growing more distinct, are beheld a forest of stately masts, a noble and beautiful fortress, a thousand small boats, of shapes new and undreamt of hy the visitant, skimming over the stream ; the larger vessels of the country, pleasant to look upon even for their strange dis-symmetry and their consequent unwieldiness ; the green barge or budgerow, lying idly for hire, and the airy httle"], [149, "125 THE CALCUTTA GHAUTS. bauleahs, with their hght venetian'd rooms. There cannot be a scene more beautiful, connected with the bustle and business of life, and the heart of the traveller feels hght within him as he views it. As you advance up the river, you observe architectural decorations, resembling gates, on the left or northern bank. These are ghauts, or landing-places. The first is Prinsep's Ghaut, erected to commemorate James Prinsep, one of the most eminent men of his day, who fell a sacrifice to his ardour in the pursuit of science. It is a huge and ugly pile. Not far from this is a monument of Saracenic architecture, composed of the cannon taken at the battles of Gwalior and Punniah, and designed to commemorate those events. Higher up is Rajchunder Doss's Ghaut, a large, neat, and commodious landing-place, the nearest point of convenient debarcation for persons proceeding to Chowringhee. The wealthy native at whose expense it was built, has not failed to perpetuate his own name, as well as that of the Governor- General under whose administration it was constructed, by a marble tablet placed over the entrance from the land side. Within a few yards of this ghaut stands the steam-engine which supplies with water the aqueducts, from which some of the more patrician streets of the town are watered. It is one of the most useful estabhshments in the City of Palaces, and tbe only wonder is, that in the metropolis of so great an empire, which yields a revenue of twenty crores of rupees a year, it is the only steam-engine erected for this important object ; and that, of the streets which might be benefited by it, more than half are without aqueducts, and are rendered obscure by clouds of suffocating dust, during many months of the year. We next come to the Chandpaul Ghaut \u2014 named, it is sup posed, after one Chandur Pal, who once kept a httle grocer's shop in its vicinity. It is here where India welcomes and bids adieu to her rulers. It is here that the Governors- General, Commanders-in-Chief, the Judges of the Supreme Court, the Bishops, _Src, first set foot in the metropolis. Moving up from Chandpaul Ghaut along a noble strand, we reach Colvin's Ghaut, and in its immediate vicinity is the Police Ghaut, now adorned by the Metcalfe Hall. The next ghaut in succession is Coelah Ghaut ; and not far from that,"], [150, "126 THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER. the old Fort Ghaut. In the square which separates these landing-places, a fort originally stood. The space i occupied by the Export Warehouse and the, Custom House, through which merchandise to the value of fifteen millions sterhng is annually passed. Just above the old Fort Ghaut stands the Bonded Warehouse, the only corporation in Cal cutta besides the Bank of Bengal. Higher up are other ghauts, numerous but not very remarkable. The last of any consequence is called Beebee Ross's \u2014 named after a Mrs. Ross. Calcutta is built on an almost dead level, which s th . character of the far-surrounding country, so that it is cal culated to be raised hardly so much as one foot above the mean of high water, though there is a slight fall from the bank of the river to the eastward, in the direction of the salt-water lake, which terminates the Soonder-bunds, or small estuaries, flowing from the sea to within four miles east of Calcutta. The soil is a rich alluvium, mixed with micaceous sand, and resting, at some depth below the surface, on a blackish clay ; and such is its aptitude for imbibing and retaining moisture, that in spite of the heat of the climate, the earth is always damp, and the air in general humid. The metropolis of British India, and emporium of eastern commerce, is situated in lat. 22\u00b0 33' 54' N, long. 88\u00b0 20' 17\" E, on the eastern bank of the river Hooghly, which is merely a branch, being the most westerly one, of the Ganges, and is at the distance of nearly one hundred miles from the sea. The breadth of the stream, winch is deep, muddy, and rapid, is about equal to that of the Thames at Gravesend ; and ships of from twelve to fourteen hundred tons anchor abreast of the city, either in six or seven fathoms, near mid-channel, or at the chain moorings within a few yards of the shore, where they are fastened head and stern, so as not to swing with the tide. We have said that the coup d'\u0153il from the river impresses the beholder with an idea of magnificence in regard to the width of the streets and the splendour of the houses in external architecture ; but although the bare facts which justify the inference remain, upon a nearer view of the objects, which have still the characteristic grandeur of spa-"], [151, "127 DIVISIONS OF THE CITY. ciousness in their respective ways, yet the first impression, which is derived from the mind's belief in the existence of unqualified splendour, is, on the nearer view, discovered to be in a great measure illusory. The houses continue, indeed, to be justly considered by the stranger superior to the great majority of the town residences in the principal capitals of Europe ; but the eye is soon offended, and that grievously, by the admixture of mean and dirty huts, which abound in some of the finest streets, and come almost into contact with the colonnaded mansions. These mean and wretched looking buildings are occupied, principally, during the day time only, as shops, by the native venders of commodities connected with the consumption or the petty handicrafts of the people. For municipal purposes, the city of Calcutta is quartered out into four divisions. To each division a magistrate is appointed, who, however, does not reside, nor even hold his sittings, within the precincts of his beat, as the only police office in the place is situated in the Loll Bazaar, near the north-western extremity of the English part of the town. The conventional divisions of the city, which are but two, are tolerably wed defined : \u2014 A hne drawn from Beebee Ross's Ghaut, or landing-place, on the river-bank, due east, to the Upper Circular-road, and from Hastings's-bridge, on the Tolly's Nullah, in a north-easterly direction, to the Lower Circular-road, will include the whole of the space occupied by the Christian part of the community ; while a similar process of demarcation, _oiT.m_r._ing at Beebee Ross's Ghaut and running eastward as above mentioned, including all the streets northward as far as Chitpore-bridge and the boundary of the Mahratta Ditch, a now useless and unseemly excavation, commenced in the middle of the eighteenth century, and encircling the city from its northern extremity to a point on its opposite boundary, whl com prehend the greater portion of the city which is occupied by natives. There is, however, this material difference to be observed in the two localities, namely, that a considerable part of the European division is occupied by natives \u2014 chiefly Mussulmans and the lower castes of Hindoos \u2014 while very few Christians have their abode in the native quarter. In this latter, with but a few exceptions, the streets are, like"], [152, "128 THE HOUSES OF CALCUTTA those of most Oriental towns, exceedingly narrow, aud tin. hous. s lofty, the lower apartments being used for shops or store-rooms, while the more strictly domiciliary parts of the building, above, are primitively garnished with loop instead of windows, and the backs of the houses are for the most part to the streets. Some dwellings, indeed. are which have the convenience of windows and balconies, but even those are, in general, most sorry imitations of the European style ; and from being commonly unpainted, and never kept in good repair, present that mean and dilapidate ' appearance which is a characteristic of the native archi tectural constructions, both public and private \u2014 the dv. house, the temple, the ghaut, serai, and bridge. And from this sweeping condemnation of the thriftlessnes3 and want of taste of the people of Hindostan, can be excepted only the very few houses belonging to certain opulent natives in Calcutta, who have grafted the European customs on their own, and whose residences are fitted up with consid elegance and judgment ; and there are many, also, among the native upper classes, generally, who, though they cannot totally wean themselves from the customs of their country, are ambitious of having their houses furnished and decorated in the English way, which, however, ill assimilates with the confined dimensions and dark interiors incidental to the style of Eastern architecture. Hence an incongruity wliich makes apartments thus bedizened, look paltry amid mag nificence, and tawdry and disarranged, though every article in them may be costly and, in its individual character, free from meretriciousness. The business part of Calcutta, or what in England would be termed \" the city,\" and which in India is known by the designation of \" the town,\" is comprised between Chandpaul Ghaut and the New Mint, on the river-bank, eastward ; and from the former to the head of Cossitollah Street, at its junction with the Dhurrumtollah and Chowringhee roads ; and in a similar direction from the New Mint to the Burra Bazaar, a line drawn from the latter to the Cossitollah com pleting the definement. The fashionable end is at Chow ringhee ; but as Calcutta is made up of an official and a mercantile community, and can boast of no exclusive circle in resemblance to the \" fashionable \" one of London, the"], [153, "129 THE STREETS OF CALCUTTA. distinctive appellation bestowed on the quarter just mentioned has originated more in the circumstance of its being locally apart, and yet near enough to the scenes of both commer cial and official business, to render it a convenient residence for high functionaries and wealthy merchants, than from any difference in their social modes of life from the practice of their fellow-exiles. A few of the streets in the European town are of great dimensions ; as the Chowringhee Road, for instance, wliich is nearly two miles long, and in average width not less than eighty feet ; but it has houses on only one (the eastern) side, facing the extensive plain, or maidan, which separates it from the river. The Dhurrumtollah is nearly equal, in dimensive character, to this ; and being on each side bordered by a row of houses of good elevation, and many of them even splendid in their outward appearance \u2014 with but compara tively few native hut-edifices on its line \u2014 it would claim to be considered a first-rate street in any western capital. A short way down this road is the Chandny Bazaar, where the street is usually much crowded by retailers of cloth and various other articles, who seriously encroach on the pubhc thoroughfare. Wellesley Road would be acknowledgedly a fine street, were it not lined, almost continuously, with native huts, and exposed to the greater nuisance of the Ka lassee, or native seamen's quarter, which is situated about the middle of it \u2014 near the spot at which it intersects the Jaun Bazaar Street \u2014 and is inhabited by a debauched and otherwise totally demoralized mass of people. The Upper and Lower Circular Roads, which nearly encompass the city on its eastern or landward side, are long and of noble pro portions ; but the Mahratta Ditch, with much jungle in une back-ground, forms a drawback to perfection of the scene. In the Chowringhee quarter there are many fine though not long streets ; among which the one called Russell Street, debouching at either end into Park and Middletou Streets, respectively, takes rank among the best. Camac Street is also a very good street, and towards its southern extremity has numerous huts, and much unoccupied ground ; both of which circumstances are destructive of true town beauty, and give an appearance of mingled wretchedness and deso lation, which detracts from the effect of even adjacent com- ic"], [154, "130 CALCUTTA SHOPS. pleteness. Park Street is a somewhat long, but dispro portionately narrow street, having some good houses on its line, and has always been considered an abiding-place of the first respectability. But it has one great disadvantage in being the thoroughfare for funerals to the English Protestant cemetery, which is situated at its eastern termination. Loudon Street, which is near the eastern end of that just delineated, has several good houses of recent erection ; but it, too, is disfigured by unseemly and barbarous hovels. Until within the last fifteen years, Calcutta was destitute of one architectural feature which marks all towns in Eng land and in various other parts. We allude to th of regular shop-fronts, which distinguish the place of busi ness from the private abode, and which, when tastefully designed and sample-adorned, as in London, yield an orna ment to the streets, and eloquently proclaim the prosperity of the country. Calcutta is still deficient, when compared to English towns, in this pleasing and convenient system, and from climatic difficulties must probably remain so ; for goods exposed to the heat and glare in a window would speedily deteriorate, and meanwhile there would be no pedes trian customers to be attracted by the display. But of late, there have been shop-fronts added to the lower stories of several of the houses in Council House Street, Cossitollah, and other streets, and the propensity towards this kind of improvement is daily increasing among the European trades men. StiH the shops must be entered ere goods can be beheld ; and thus the place, though in reality the theatre of a most extensive commerce, has not, as far as the exterior of the trades houses is concerned, anything of the bustling and busy look, which are characteristics of European sea ports. To a person, however, of very ordinary power of observation, the number of vehicles, describable and inde scribable, which navigate the streets, including very many laden bullock-carts ; and the concourse of employed natives whom ou every side he must perceive, would be adequate proof of the place being an emporium of first-rate conse quence, even did not the abundance of shipping, and the shoals of concomitant small craft, sufficiently of themselves give assurance of the fact. Calcutta has no avails, barriers, or other outward appli-"], [155, "131 AN INDIAN BAZAAR. ances of a fortified town \u2014 for the circum vallation, called the Mahratta Ditch, merits no such rank ; nor is there need of such defences, not only in the improbability of its ever being attacked, but from the vicinity of Fort William, which commands the circumjacent country, and which, on an emer- gency, could contain the whole Christian population, and in the face of which no enemy could retain a footing in the town. Its principal defect, as a place besieged, would consist in its being, from internal resources, unsupplied with drink- able water, save from a tank, or pond, on the southern glacis, within only a few hundred feet of the ramparts. Although, hke other capitals, it can boast its bazaars, yet the reader who pictures these mart-places in his mind, according to any pattern taken from the Pantheon, Baker Street, Soho Square, or other similar establishments in London, will be grievously mistaken. The India Bazaar is a scene of riot, knavery, prostitution, and filthiness, exhibit- ing, moreover, the mercantile incongruity of the costliest manufactures in the merest dens, and the often disgusting necessaries of the native culinary department, such as rancid and uncleanly ghee,* and bad and bitter oil, attainting the air, which is at the same time impregnated by the Sab\u00e6an odours of uttur, frankincense, and aromatic spices. The City of Palaces is, with rare and recent exceptions, most wretch- edly hghted by means of sordid oil-lamps, supplied with material of so inferior a description, that even the inside of the lamp is scarcely illuminated, and placed at the respect- able distances of the corners of the streets, or other wide intervals, few and far between. Neither is the city watched, or paved, or efficiently regulated in its municipal relations, in all pertaining to which it is considerably behind a second- rate English provincial town. There are no large bridges within the city, but some very neat suspension-bridges over the creeks and canals (at either end of the town) which debouch into the river Hooghly. The city of Calcutta is supplied with good drinking water from a considerable number of large ponds (called tanks), for the most part situated towards the Chowringhee quarter ; but the one which gives the name to Tank Square * Clari6ed butter.

It is, unfortunately, liable to be occasionally brackish, in consequence of its vicinity to the liver, from which, in dry seasons, it is now and tl i nished ; and this deterioration is the more to be lamented, as the tank in question forms the only local source of supply to a very thickly-peopled portion of the city. Iu these junctures, most of the European families, and several of them, indeed, uniformly, procure the water for their table uses from the tanks on the plain, of which there are several, and all containing water of excellent quality ; but that which bears away the elemental palm from the rest of the temperance fountains, is a tank in the Free School grounds, which has the advantage of land-springs. All the tanks obtain \" annual supplies \" from the periodical rains , and therefore, in seasons when these happen to be scanty, much distress Ls endured, ere their recurrence, by the general popu lation ; and this distress is especially great during the ensuing hot months, when the ponds come to then ebb, and their then remnant of water becomes turbid, in consequence of the incessant drain which is made on it at that parching period. Calcutta has extensive, irregular, and thickly native- peopled suburbs; but the Europeans, thereabouts, are and their houses far apart. Of these suburbal localities, that of Garden Reach, about four miles to the south of the town, is by far the most important, and indeed, magnificent ; some of the buildings being on a scale of much grandeur and elegance, and surrounded by extensive grounds, laid out in miniature representations of the beautiful parks of England. One of these houses, distinguished by the rest from its classic elegance, is the residence of tbe agent for the Peninsular and Oriental Company. Here is the anchorage of the magnificent steamers which ply betweeu Suez and Calcutta. Eastward of Garden Reach are Allipore and Balligunge, both considered healthy spots, and the latter having a few \u25a0rood houses round an extensive plain, in which are placed the Jine3 of the Governor-General's body-guard After a"], [157, "133 CLIMATE OF CALCUTTA. long interval, and in a northerly direction, comes Entally \u2014 a suburb branching out from the eastern side of the Circular Road, opposite its junction with the Dhurrumtollah. Still farther to the north, at the head of the Boi taconnah or Bow Bazaar Road, lies the Sealdah or Baliaghaut Road, leading to the Salt-water Lake, where there are a few good resi dences ; and thence, stretching to a great extent to the north-west, are Simlah and other suburbs, entirely occupied by natives, and interspersed with the garden-houses, or sub urban retreats of the wealthy merchants and other men of fortune among the aborigines. To the north of the town of Calcutta, at the extremity of the Chitpore Road, and on the bank of the Hooghly, is the village of Cossipore. Here is the government foundry, some steam-engines and flour-mill, and a paper-manufactory. Here also are several villas, which are more healthily situated than any others in the vicinity of Calcutta, because they have the advantage of a large expanse of river to the south, across which the wind comes cool and refreshing, and freed from impurities. In regard to climate, Calcutta may be described as subject to the extremity of moisture, and nearly to that of heat. In January the air is serene and cold.

Population. \u2014 A belief had long been prevalent, that Calcutta was a thickly-populated town, and some estimates made the number of inhabitants amount to nearly half a million. Recent and accurate surveys, however, have suffi ciently established the fact, that its resident population does not much exceed two hundred and twenty thousand, comprised within the proper hmits of the city, which stretch for a dis tance of four miles along the banks of the river, and to about one mile and a half, at the greatest extension, inland. The old errors upon this subject, whence flowed so much exagge ration, arose, no doubt, from the vast influx of people from the adjacent villages, who have employment in town, or who"], [159, "135 POPULATION. attend the bazaars with the produce of their gardens or fields, and to procure for themselves those necessaries which, in the first instance, are all swept into the Calcutta markets. From this cause the place appears to be swarming with population ; and as, besides, the men who happen to be unemployed are more in the habit of lounging or lying about the streets than of keeping within their houses, the observer who trusted to his eyes merely for the formation of a census, would arrive at a far higher calculation than the more syste- matic investigator into censual truth. The following tabular estimate exhibits at one view the number and classified description of the population : \u2014 English 3,138 Eurasians .. .. .. .. .. 4,746 Portuguese .. .. .. .. .. 3,181 French 160 Chinese 362 Armenians . . . . . . . . . . 636 Jews . . 307 Western Mahomedans . . . . . . 13,677 Bengal Mahomedans .. .. .. 45,067 Western Hindoos 17,333 Bengal Hindoos 120,318 Moguls 527 Parsees .. .. .. .. .. 40 Arabs 351 Mugs 683 Madrassees . . . . \u2022 . . . . . . 55 Native Christians . . . . . . . . 49 Low Castes 19,084 Total 229,714 Among this great variety of the human race, there is little or no collision in the important struggle for the obtain ment of subsistence ; and hence, in a great measure, arises the blessing of internal public tranquillity, which is uniformly experienced in this magnificent, yet motley-peopled capital. No one class interferes in any objectionable way with the pursuits of another, but, on the contrary, the course of occupation causes each class to assist the others, for the pro motion of its own individual interest ; and caste, climate, and prejudice, effect as true and politic a division of labour as meditation and design have been able to do in England. In India the system has its evil as well as its good. The evil is,"], [160, "136 THE ENGLISH IX CALCUTTA. the prevention of competition and improvement in tbe different professions to which the natives incline. In England, every man can follow any trade he pleases ; but in India, the son of the tailor may not become a shoemaker; nor must the family of the blacksmith recruit the ranks of the carpenter. If a washerman were starving for want of employment, he would never dream of turning barber, though in his neighbourhood there might be a paucity of the chattering tribe ; nor would a starving barber seek a Uveli hood by starting as a water-carrier. We have here spoken of the classes of tribes ; but among the tribes themselves there is nearly the same separation of pursuits, and the same variation of means for attaining the one great and common end \u2014 subsistence. The Calcutta English, who are not in the East-India Company's service, may be divided into the three main classes of the mercantile, the retail dealers, and the artisans. The numerically minor bodies belonging to the church and the law, it is not necessary to notice particularly ; and the sea faring persons form, of course, properly, no portion of the residentiary British community. Of these three major divisions of our own peculiar people, the artisans are those whom the uninitiated reader might, at the first blush, suppose inevitably instrumental in causing a clash with the native artificers, and thus demonstrating the fallacy of our proposi tion on that subject. But the fact is, that the British mechanics in Calcutta are all in the capacities of master workmen, and are not, in the English understanding of the term, actual labourers in their crafts at all. The tailors, shoemakers, house-builders, coach-makers, carvers and gilders, cabinet-makers, and the hke, are practically no more than supervisors of the work (including instruction to some extent), in the laborious part of which, or what is literally the manufacturing department, natives are employed as journey men j and thus,) instead of being jostled out of employment by the introgression of Europeans, they have employment secured to them at a better rate of wages than their own master-manufacturers could afford to bestow. On the other hand, the native master- artisans lose httle or no custom by the similar speculations of their pale-faced brethren ; for the shoes and clothes of the aborigines are of a peculiar kind"], [161, "137 MAHOMEDANS AND HINDOOS. and quality, and such as the emigrants would be incapable of producing at the uniform market price; while of such articles as are suitable for European wear or other use, many are sought by our countrymen from the native on account of the immediate cheapness, as it is often more convenient to renew a cheap article at comparatively frequent intervals, than to pay largely down for such as may last you longer. To the Enghsh trader, manufacturer, or vender, we recom mend Europeans invariably to apply in preference to resorting to the natives. \" Europe shops,\" as they are called, are so nearly on a level with those of the China Bazaar, that there is httle to be gained, where there used to be much, by having recourse to native dealers, especially if we take into account the extra trouble of the process, and the higgling about the cost. Of the entire mass of Mahomedans and Hindoos, exclu sively of the degraded castes of the latter, which forms a recognised portion of the inhabitants of Calcutta, it is pro bable that a full moiety are in the service of the Europeans ; and that of this moiety the far greater division may be ranged under the head of domestic servants, and the remain der described as employed in the government and mercantile offices, in the capacity of under-clerks, messengers, and the like inferior, yet trustworthy employments. The other half of the entire number subsist themselves by what may be termed street or river labour, in contradistinction to that which is rural, and find employment in carrying palankeens as bearers, and parcels as coolies, or porters. The employ ments are perfectly distinct, and though each is pursued by Hindoos, yet neither would interchange the modus operandi \u2014 it being against the prejudice of caste for a bearer to carry any weight upon his head, or for a coolie to do so on his back or shoulder. The honesty of the coolie is proverbial over India. Paid at a rate not exceeding at the utmost three pence sterling a day, and often at a lower rate than that ; and employed to convey parcels of value and of easy appro priation from place to place, we are not aware of many instances of a coolie having been found guilty of a breach of trust, even in circumstances where detection was next to impossible and the temptation great.

Such as remain to be mentioned, after the deduction of these two principal classes from the aggregate, gain their livelihood as boatmen, dealers in grain, oil, cloth, and other articles of every-day consumption by the population at large ; and as workmen in the various trades which are requisite to supply the household demands of their multifarious fellow-citi The rest of the inhabitants of Calcutta are sufficiently described in the section appropriated to the population of India generally. Public Buildings. \u2014 From the high reputation Calcutta has acquired for the palatial character of her buildings, it might be supposed that the city boasted of many noble pubhc edifices. This, however, is far from the fact. It is upon the number of superb private mansions that Calcutta must rely to bear out the character she enjoys, for it is only within the last half-century that her inhabitants have considered it incumbent upon them to erect buildings for particular public objects. The practice has been, when an institution has been formed, to locate it in the first instance in a spacious private dwelling, and only to give it a special habitation when the purposes of the establishment have been extended, or the funds increased to an amount that would admit of the extra outlay. Thus, there are not more than eighteen erections, not including places of worship, in the town, which deserve to be called \" public,\" on the score of their having been originally built for the reception of a public establishment ; these are : \u2014 The Government House, the Town Hall, the Writers' Buildings, the Metcalfe Hall, the Hindoo College, the"], [163, "139 THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE. Madrussa or Mahomedan College, the General Assembly's Institution, the Jesuits' College, the Medical College, the Mechanics' Institute, the Orphan School, the General Hospital, the Ice House, the Ochterlony Monument, the Martiniere, the Race Stand, the Asiatic Society's Rooms, and the Mint. The Government House. \u2014 The Government House was built about the year 1804, at the instance of the late Mar quis of Wellesley, then Governor-General. The architect was Captain Wyatt, of the corps of engineers, and the ex pense of erection about thirteen lacs of rupees, or about (in those days) 150,000Z. sterling. The building is a noble one. The external view is grand and imposing, notwithstanding its numerous windows and its want of height. The veran dahs are rather mean for so large a building. The columns have angular Ionic capitals. The grand entrance is on the northern side, by a handsome flight of steps leading to the first floor. It is seldom used, owing to its being entirely exposed, an entrance underneath the stairs being preferred by those who have occasion to go to the house. The position ofthe dome has often been objected to, and not unjustly: it is situated between the southern wings, and excepting when seen from the south, it always appears out of place, from not being in the centre of the whole building. The wings on the southern side are surmounted by the royal arms : those on the northern are ornamented by the Honourable Com pany's. The greatest credit appears due to the architect for the interior accommodation. It may be considered perfect, as far as convenience is concerned, and splendid in every re spect, with the exception of the staircases, as a fit and pro per residence for the supreme ruler of our Indian possessions. The centre of the building consists of three large rooms. The ground-floor, being low, is chiefly occupied with offices, &c. The centre of the first-floor is a grand marble-hall, formed by the three rooms, the entrance of which has a row of columns. They are used on occasions of entertainment as the dining and supper rooms, according to the extent of the company. Above them are the ball-rooms. The floors are of varnished teak neatly laid ; the ceilings are orna mented and covered, so as to conceal the beams ; the gilding is tasteful and neat. From the roof are suspended numerous"], [164, "140 THE HINDOO COLLEGE. chandeliers, while the sides of the rooms and between the windows are lined with handsome mirrors. The four wings, which may be considered as distinct houses, are connected in the centre by means of commodious galleries. They are everyway convenient and comfortable, and are occupied by the Governor-General, or the Lieut. -Governor of Bengal and his suite. All the out-offices are det and in no way interfere with the view of the room. Upon the whole, the place is a splendid conception, and few men, forty years ago (at any rate, in India), excepting the tect himself, would have elicited from their own invention anything so complete and satisfactory. Hindoo College. \u2014 This institution was projected near the close of the year 1815. It owes its origin to a most zealous advocate for native education, the late Mr. David Hare. The idea of such au establishment occurred to his mind in the course of a discussion, at the house of the cele brated Rammohun Roy, on the best means of improving the moral and intellectual condition of the people of India. Having written down his thoughts on the subject, the paper was shown to several individuals, amongst whom was a native gentleman, who without communicating his intention to Mr. Hare, handed it directly to Sir Edward Hyde East, then Chief Judge of the Supreme Court, soliciting his patron age and support of the scheme under consideration. The learned judge was so much pleased with Mr. Hare's sugges tion, that he entered immediately into almost all hL_ views, and after having proposed a few trifling alterations in that gentleman's plan for the establishment of the college, he con vened a meeting of respectable natives at his own hon the purpose of carrying the design into speedy execution. After various meetings, it was resolved \" that an institution for promoting education be established, and that it be called the Hindoo College of Calcutta ; and that the Governor-General, and the members of the Supreme Council for the time being, be requested to accept the office of patrons of this institu tion.\" It was also resolved, that Sir Edward Hyde East should be requested to accept the office of president. A committee was appointed, consisting of both native and European gentlemen, and to these were added an English and a native secretary."], [165, "141 THE COLLEGE BUILT. The primary object of the institution was the tuition of Hindoo children in the English and Indian languages, and in the literature and science of Europe and Asia. The committee hired a building as a temporary schoolhouse, and on the 20th January, 1817, the school was opened. On that day there were but twenty pupils, but a learned native who was present expressed his hopes that the Hindoo College would resemble the bur, the largest of trees, which yet at first was but a small seedling. In less than three months the number of boys was sixty-nine, all of whom made Eng lish their principal study. The funds of the college amounted at this time to upwards of 70,000 rupees, but notwithstand ing this auspicious commencement, the expenses connected with the establishment were soon discovered to be much beyond the means at the disposal of the management, and as a consequence some appointments were abolished, and cer tain expenditures were reduced. Still, the school declined, and the government was appealed to for help. Pecuniary aid was immediately granted ; and the Governor-General in Council having determined to found a Sanscrit College in Calcutta, for the special purpose of reviving native hterature, it was deemed advisable to erect a large and handsome building, that might accommodate all the classes of both institutions. The foundation stone of this edifice was laid on the 25th of February, 1824. The present building was opened for the reception of the classes of the two institutions in the month of May, 1827. The centre part of the build ing was to be devoted to the Sanscrit students, and the two wings to the senior and junior departments of the Anglo- India school. A vice-president of the committee and visitor of the college was appointed, together with sundry lecturers and teachers, selecting them from the ablest men whose ser vices were available. The government likewise presented an excellent library to the Hindoo College, and have for some years contributed largely towards the general expenses of the college. A wealthy rajah presented a donation of 20,000 rupees, which was devoted to the institution of scholarships, the object of which was, by a monthly bursary of sixteen rupees, to induce pupils of the first class, who would otherwise be obliged to quit college in search of a livelihood, to remain longer and finish their education."], [166, "142 THE EDIFICE. In 1831, the government authorized the appointment of a professor of law and moral philosophy. In 1835, owing to the retirement or resignation of some of the professors, and the difficulty of filling their places satisfactorily, a new distribution of duties took place. The office of lecturer on mathematics and English literature. which had hitherto been united, was now divided. 8nb_B quently, a principal was appointed in the person of Captain David Lester Richardson, author of \" Literary Leaves,\" <fec, who, however, was removed from the office at the instance of the President of the Council of Education, Mr. Bethune, for reasons that have not been universally held to be valid. The Hindoo College is one of the handsomest buildings in Calcutta. It is of the plain Grecian Ionic order. The grand entrance is on the north, and a flight of stone steps leads to a portico supported by four lofty columns. The portico leads into a square open court, on the east and west sides of which are colonnades, which form the entrance into the lower apartments, devoted to the Sanscrit classes. At the south-west corner of the western colonnade is the prin- cipal staircase, which leads to the large upper hall of the centre building. This hall, as well as the one beneath it, measures eighty-four feet by twenty- six. In the upper colonnades, east and west of the court, are galleries forming passages into the several side apartments, one of which is devoted to the college library, which contains a large supply of the best works on the literature and science of Europe, with many of the most approved translations from the Greek and Roman classics. A book, in which the titles of the works borrowed and the names of the borrowers are kept, affords an interesting illustration of the taste and acquirements of the students. European visitors are often greatly surprised, on inspecting this record, to observe how much works demanding serious thought, the closest study, and an exertion of the highest faculties of the mind, are voluntarily sought after by these aspiring boys, most of whose parents are as ignorant as their forefathers 5,000 years ago. On the south side of the building is a large portico, supported by six columns, on a well-raised pediment. The two wings are of the same order as the centre building, but of one story only. The eastern wing is occupied with"], [167, "143 THE STUDENTS OF THE COLLEGE. the junior department or lower classes of the Hindoo Col lege, and the western wing is devoted to the upper classes. The professors deliver their lectures in the upper apartments of the centre building. The entire edifice, including nume rous out-offices, stands on an area of 470 feet by 190 feet. Within the enclosure, which is defined by a handsome iron rail, is a large circular tank and neat lawn. Thus much of the college and its purposes. It would be agreeable to follow the student from its portals, and trace the effects of the instruction he has received upon the society with which he thenceforth mingles. But it is much to be apprehended that, at present, the advantage stops short with the student himself. Many of the students in the first and second classes of the Hindoo College are enabled to procure respectable situations under government, and all of them who require employment find a college education of most essential advan tage to them. The certificate of character and acquirements which each boy obtains on quitting the institution, when very favourable, is regarded as an invaluable document, and esteemed of higher importance and utility than any private letter of introduction. Even the more wealthy students who do not seek for employment are proud of the honour of a good college certificate. It is amongst those in rather dependent circumstances that the love of learning is longest cherished. Amongst those who have to spend every entire day in official toil or the pursuits of trade, and return exhausted to the idle converse of their families, the desire for intellectual pleasure very speedily cools, and they lose all that generous ambition to distinguish themselves by their talents or their attainments, which they evince in association with their class-fellows. But those who are not doomed to a perpetual struggle for the means of existence, often con tinue to study very sedulously the books recommended to them when at college ; and they sometimes contrive to pro long an acquaintance with their teachers by occasional visits, or even letters. They are, however, in an awkward and un encouraging position, for their parents and immediate asso ciates rarely smile upon their studies, and the English fr> India are, generally speaking, even yet too aristocratic to meet the advances of the natives in a true spirit of sociality."], [168, "144 THE METROPOLITAN COLLEGE. There is too often a proud condescension on the one od a humiliation on the other. We cannot expect the n of India to advance much in the scale of society, until we hold out the ready hand of fellowship to all who distinguish themselves by their talents or their virtues. The Hindoo Metropolitan College. \u2014 The Council of Education having determined to admit all denominations of Hindoos to study in the Hindoo College, the orthodox Hindoos recently seceded, and have established a new college for themselves, which at this moment (July, 1853) ntu 600 pupils. On the subject of this new educational institu tion, the Friend of India has the following remarks : \u2014 \" The new college commences with many advantages in its favour, and yet we cannot but regard its institution as a fatal mistake on the part of its founders. Great care hah taken to destroy the impression which had got abroad, that it was intended to oppose the government institution. It is to be a ' sister college,' and ' there may be a zealous, but not it is hoped by any means an angry, emulation between this College and the Hindoo College.' The matter is one of ex ceedingly httle importance, for an opposition which tak form of building colleges, cannot but be agreeable to a civi lized government. But one thing is certain. It has been estabhshed to prove the hostility of its founders to the prin ciple of religious freedom. It has Christians for its masters, and Hindoos for its managers, but its origin is none the less hatred of all creeds except that which its founders profess. It has not been estabhshed from any dread of ' proselytisni.' Even Hindoos have not yet accused the Council of Education of any such design. It is simply intended to preserve Hin doo youth from the contamination of the presence of Maho medans or Christians. The very men who are most anxious to equalize the natives and the Europeans, who petition Par liament to set aside all distinctions of caste and colour, and who talk of religious oppression when the law declares that the Legislature is not bound to starve a convert, expend thou sands of rupees to prevent a few Hindoos from learning the use of the globes with a Christian or Mahomedan. They demand perfect religious equality, while endeavouring to maintain a vexatious social persecution ; and demonstrate, by their acts, that however loud their tongues may be in favour"], [169, "145 THE METROPOLITAN COLLEGE. of perfect liberty, they are in heart Hindoos still, the un changed and unchangeable advocates of exclusiveness. It will not be forgotten by the British Parhament, that the com munity which is clamouring for an increase of legislative power, has at one time declared its intention of maintaining the law that strips the convert of the last shred of his patri monial property ; and at another, spent thousands of rupees, rather than allow the rising generation to work the fifth pro position of Euclid with Christians or Mahomedans. The Enghsh people have gradually learnt to comprehend the mo tives of those who oppose the \"mixed schools\" of Ireland, and will bave httle difficulty in applying their experience to the meridian of Calcutta. \" Notwithstanding the ardent zeal of its projectors, the ability of its professors, and the chorus of approval with which the new college has been received, we cannot flatter its founders with any hopes of permanent success. Too many attempts of the kind have been made within the last few years for us to repose any confidence in its stability. Unless endowed at once on a scale sufficient to create interests of its own, and to give individuals importance by the management of its funds, it must, if we may reason from analogy, gradually decline. The history of the Hindoo College is in itself an epitome of the histories of all native institutions. It was at first enthusiastically supported, and its funds appeared large enough to ensure it at least the vitality inherent in a well-endowed charity. But the enthusiasm diminished, the funds gradually decreased, and after some years of lethargy, it was compelled to apply to government for assistance. We see no reason to believe that the Metropolitan College will share a different fate from its predecessor. It begins in en thusiasm, will run the round of indifference, neglect, lethargy, and decay, and terminate in government support.\" The Sanscrit College. \u2014 The Sanscrit College is supported entirely by the government. This institution was established for the encouragement of Oriental learning ; but a few years ago, a teacher was employed to teach the students reading and writing the English language. Little progress, however, was made in their occidental studies, and English instruction was some time discontinued. As at the Hindoo College, with the exception of a very few stipendiary scholars, all the boys L"], [170, "146 THE MADRUSSA. pay for their instruction. The students at the Sanscrit and other colleges under government superintendence, at present contribute nothing towards the expenses of the education. The immediate management of the Sanscrit College is under a native secretary. The institution next in degree to the Hindoo Colleges, as being particularly adapted to the instruction of natives in the higher branches of learning, though by no means approaching it in point of utility, is The Madrussa, or Mahomedan College. \u2014 This insti tution was founded in the year 1780, by Warren Hastings, who, at his own expense, erected a building for the eo and obtained from government, for the support of the estab hshment, a grant of land, estimated at 29,000 rupees per annum. The object of the founder was to encourage the cultivation of Arabic learning, and to prepare persons with a perfect knowledge of Mahomedan law, to act as public officers in the courts of justice. In the year 1820, government, fully convinced that such an institution would never produce any useful results while under the control of natives, appoii. committee of Company's servants, with a secretary, to direct the studies and enforce the rules which they might deem necessary to establish. From that period the college rapidly improved ; learned professors were sought, and the studious were rewarded ; the revenue of the college fixed at 30,004 rupees per annum, instead of the original jaghir ; and a new building was erected on the north side of Wellesley Square, at the charge of 1,40,537 rupees. In 1829, an English school was attached to the Madrussa ; but from the jealousy with which the Mahomedans view Enghsh literature and science, and from a behef that the school was formed to undermine their religion and render Arabic literature less pre-eminent, it was rather opposed than supported by the native influence in the college. Very few of the Arabic students availed themselves of this new source of information, and generally those that attended, did it more as a matter of form than from inclination. Out-students were admitted and dismissed as changes took place in the committee, and nothing seemed certain but that whatever was done one year would be altered the next. A radical reform was, however, introduced, yet not without violent opposition from the most celebrated Ori-"], [171, "147 the town hall. ental scholars in the education committee. Under these and other adverse circumstances the school languished until lately, when a change of system was resolved upon. The Arabic students were no longer compelled to learn English, and any other Mahomedan youths who wished it were allowed to do so without any payment being required from them. The result has been satisfactory. The school is now filled with boys who pursue the study of English with zeal and success equal to any of their Hindoo compeers. From this period the affairs of the college proceeded without any obstruction; opposition died away gradually, and business soon flowed into the common routine. In a late report there appeared to be forty-two paid and seventy -two unpaid students in the Arabic department, and 150 unpaid scholars in the English school. In the Arabic department there are four principal preceptors and four assistants. The course of study includes, in Arabic, general hterature, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, Mahomedan law, and mathematics. In the English, there are three masters and six monitors, the course of study in English embracing grammar, geography, astronomy, history, mathematics, natural philosophy, and general literature. The Town Hall. \u2014 This edifice was raised in pursuance of a resolution passed by the inhabitants of Calcutta, in February, 1804. It is a superb building, applied to the purposes of public meetings, balls, public dinners, concerts, dramatic performances, fancy fairs, annual examinations of schools, &c. The plan was formed principally from the consideration that such a fabric required a grand double staircase to admit numbers at the same time. The stairs are so placed as not to obstruct the air in the hot season. They are therefore situated to the north, a point from which the wind seldom blows, except in the cold weather. In their construction they are spacious, easy of ascent, and well lighted, so that the projection of these stairs serves as a measure, in a certain degree, to determine the proportions of all the other parts of the building. The whole effectually answers, affording every accommodation likely to be required on a liberal and extensive scale, but nothing useless or superfluous. The vestibule or entrance, together with the two flights of l 2"], [172, "148 THE town hall. stairs (which commodiously admit 200 persons to pass at one time), occupy tbe space of 100 feet in length by twenty seven feet in breadth, forty of which are given to the entrance, and thirty to each of the stairs. The breadth is divided into three parts, two for the steps of the ascent, and one in the centre between for music, affording ample space for two large bands. On the side walls ascending the stairs, there are places for two large pictures, meant to afford a choice situa tion and good light. To the northern front is added an open portico, under which carriages may drive and set down their company in rainy weather. Over it is contrived an open verandah or colonnade, which would render the principal apartments dark if it were closed. On each side of the stairs are two rooms of twenty-one by twenty feet, and adjoining each of them a bath. At the north-west corner, a spiral staircase to the music gallery renders it unnecessary for the musicians to enter any other part of the house. Near the western end, at about five feet distant from the centre window of the large dining-room, is the statue of Marquis Cornwallis, and at the opposite end that of the Marquis Wellesley. The great saloon, being 162 feet in length and sixty-five in breadth, will conveniently dine 800 persons in the lower floor, and accommodate the same number at public I tainments for ladies, on the other story. The southern front consists of two corner rooms, each very nearly a double cube, being forty-three feet in length by twenty-one in width ; and a centre portico, eighty-two feet by thirty. The first-mentioned apartments serve as com mittee rooms below, and as card-rooms above. The centre forms the grand entrance for those who use palankeens, car riages passing round to the northern front : above-stairs it affords a spacious roomy promenade, with a beautiful view of the river, fort, <kc. The building is raised six feet in the southern front, and flued throughout. A_n almost imper ceptible slope from the outer gates leads to the northern front, in order to facilitate the entrance into the vestibule of the great staircase. On the south it is formed by twelve stone stairs leading into the lower verandah. The height of"], [173, "the metcalfe hall* 149 the rooms from this level is twenty-three feet under the beam, and paved with marble. The upper apartments are boarded with a teak floor throughout, and twenty-seven feet in height. The ceiling is covered, and all the woodwork is of teak. The order of the architecture is Doric. It may be observed that the style is very simple, the parts of which it is composed few, but large, and particularly calculated to strike at a distance, and to ornament the town. The plan was not copied from any other edifice, but was composed ex pressly for the purpose mentioned. The amount which was set apart to build the Town Hall appears to have been seven lacs of rupees. Writers' Buildings form a handsome row of houses, connected, as in England. They are of two stories high, with one room on a floor, a kitchen, and entrance yard. They were apphed, until very late years, to the reception of the writers in the East-India Company's civil1 service during the first year after their arrival in England, but they are at present let as lodgings or counting-houses to private indivi duals. The Metcalfe Hall.^ \u2014 When Sir Charles (afterwards Lord) Metcalfe was about to return from India to reside permanently in Europe, the numerous members of the Cal- cutta community, who had long benefited by his boundless liberalities, his munificent hospitality, and the wisdom and mildness of his rule as temporary Governor-General of India, determined to pay a tribute of gratitude to their benefactor, by raising a monument that should perpetuate the recollec- tion of his many public and private virtues, and more par- ticularly signalize the last great act of his Indo-political life \u2014 the emancipation of the Indian press. Various methods of effecting this great object suggested themselves \u2014 the erection of a statue, the foundation of scholarships, the placing a bust, or a picture, with a mural inscription in let- ters of gold, in some conspicuous pubhc building, &c. ; but all gave way to the happier conceit of erecting an edifice which, while it subserved purposes of great utility, should, by its titie, commemorate the worth of the excellent Sir Charles. A pubhc library had been for some time in exist ence, but it had no better local habitation than the lower"], [174, "150 THE METCALFE HALL. rooms of the private residence of a friend to the institution. The Agricultural and Horticultural Society was equally destitute of a building adapted to the purposes of official meetings, and the depository of curious models of agricul tural implements, seeds, specimens of produce, <kc. To com bine the objects of these institutions under one edifice, and to give to it the name of the statesman who had long patronised both, appeared to be a rational proceeding, accept able alike to the public who were interested in them, and to Sir Charles Metcalfe himself. A larger sum of money wag, however, necessary, for the erection of a building of fitting dimensions and external beauty, than that subscribed exclu sively for commemorative purposes. The deficiency was accordingly made up from the funds of the Agricultural Society and the Public Library, and a piece of ground for the Metcalfe Hall having been applied for, the govern ment granted a site fronting the Strand Road and river on the west, Hare Street on the north, and opposite to the Bankshall, Master Attendants' Office, and Post Office. The order of architecture is from the portico of the Temple or Tower of the Winds, at Athens, which was chosen for its lightness and durability. A broad flight of steps leads to the portico or colonnade on the west or river front, and there is a covered colonnade entrance on the east, with another and similar flight of steps, which lead up to the lobby and internal staircase. The building is raised on a solid but ornamented basement of ten feet in height, in which there are no openings, and the columns, thirty in number and thirty-six feet high, rise from this basement and support the general entablature of the building, giving it, externally, much the appearance of a Grecian temple of one lofty story. The columns and colonnade nearly surround the whole building. They would have been carried entirely round, and a more temple-like form thereby given to the building, but the funds would not admit of it ; indeed, the limited amount of the subscription, and the necessity for so much internal accommodation, rendered curtailment of the orna ment and outward decoration necessary. Internally there are two stories ; the lower one is occupied by the Agricultural Society, and consists of a hall, sixty-"], [175, "THE MEDICAL COLLEGE. 151 three feet by thirty feet ; a seed and specimen-room, thirty six feet by twenty-four ; a museum, or room for agricultural and horticultural implements, thirty-six feet by twenty-four ; a secretary's room, twenty-four feet by twenty-four ; and a corridor, or passage leading to the main hall, thirty -six feet by twelve. All these rooms are twenty-two feet high iu the roof. The upper floor, occupied by the Calcutta Public Library, is reached by a handsome teak-wood flight of stairs, in a staircase seven feet wide ; and opposite to the secretary's room there are the same rooms above as below, only they are more thrown into one by arches ; and the roof is twenty six instead of twenty-two feet high, which admits of galleries and side-lights above. The lower story, or portion appropriated to the Agricul tural Society, has a colonnaded verandah nearly all round, and in the principal hall above is an iron rail on the river side, inside the pillars. In the interior of the building there is placed a bust of Lord Metcalfe, which, with an appropriate inscription, inti mates the reasons for the erection of the hall, and perpetuates the recollection of the many noble qualities which distin guished tbe Indian career of the worthy peer. The Medical College. \u2014 This institution was founded in February, 1834, by Lord William Bentinck. It was one of the last acts of that nobleman's administration in India, and one of the most useful. For some years previous to the establishment of the Medical College, a school of instruction for native doctors, as it was termed, had existed, under the superintendence of gentlemen of great ability, and much distinguished as Oriental scholars. In that school a number of young men were educated for the service of the govern ment in the capacity of native doctors, a very subordinate and inferior grade of medical assistants. The institution was carried on entirely in the Hindos tanee language, by a few translations in Arabic. Besides this school, an attempt was made to convey some instruction in medicine to a few students in the Hindoo and Mahomedan colleges, in the shape of a lecture twice a week. No great progress could be expected to occur from such desultory instruction, although the teachers were gentlemen of great eminence. The inefficiency of these native schools soon became appa-"], [176, "152 THE medical college. rent, and Lord William Bentinck appointed a committee to inquire into the subject and report to him upon the feasibility of establishing a more improved method of instruction in the medical department of knowledge. After considerable labour and yery patient investigation, a most masterly report upon the subject was presented, and urged upon the govern ment to establish, forthwith, a college of medicine, formed upon a very extended basis, wherein instruction might be conveyed, in the English language, by a number of lecturers having each a separate branch of study under his charge ; and it suggested that these teachers should be directed to make their instruction as practical as possible, after the model of similar establishments in Europe, more especially with reference to anatomy arid the treatment of diseases. The report also recommended that a superior class of pupils should be selected who had previously received a good Enghsh education, and that the scale of remuneration for government appointments should be increased, so as to offer encouragement to these young men to exert themselves. It was urged that such an institution would not only supply the government with well-educated medical assistants, but would be the means of improving the wretched state of medicine among the natives generally, by distributing over the country skilful practitioners in lieu of the miserable quacks who had previously formed the physicians of the native community. The government, gratified with this report, determined upon adopting its principles. Suitable rules and regulations for the qualification and reception of pupils, the establish ment of professors, &c, were drawn up and adopted, and the college formally opened. The establishment was at first placed in a house adjoining the Hindoo College, but in the mean time, the present com modious building was preparing for its reception, and the institution, in May, 1835, was located on the site it now occupies. This is situated in the centre of the native town, and covers a considerable space of ground. The buildings comprise a very spacious and handsome theatre, capable of containing 500 persons \u2014 apartments for the purpose of practical anatomy, a laboratory, museum, and a library and hospital. The grounds are extensive, and"], [177, "153 MUSEUM AND LABORATORY. afford a sine site for additional buildings, for the reception of midwifery patients, and for the general enlargement of the hospital. The Museum is now tolerably extensive. The department of pathology may, perhaps, be regarded as the best-furnished portion of this museum. Amongst the rest are some prepa rations and casts of enormous tumours, which have been removed from natives of the country. There are many magnificent specimens of neurosis and eustosis, and a col lection of urinary calculi, almost unrivalled in an}' country. There are many remarkable examples of tropical diseases of the viscera, ulcerations of the intestines, alterations and de rangements of the biliary organs, &c, together with a large number of aneurisms, diseases of arteries, and some fine pre parations of monstrosities, more particularly one of a com plete double foetus, which lived for some hours after its birth. There is a fine collection of wax models, and nume rous full-sized figures of dissected parts of Auzoun, &c, <kc. The osteological branch of this department is well furnished, and it is especially rich in skulls of various nations and cha racters ; amOngst others, two crania of Suttee women are very interesting to the stranger. The Laboratory contains, among numerous interesting articles, a magnificent series of galvanic batteries, an enor mous electro-magnet, the bars of which are three inches in diameter, by six feet long ; and some very curious models illustrative of the apphcation of electro-magnetic forces to the movements of machinery, propulsion of boats and car riages, and effecting of telegraphic communications. The pupils are maintained on monthly stipends, ranging according to their seniority and deserts. Besides these youths, there is a numerous supplementary class of candidate pupils \u2014 natives, East Indians, and members of the subordinate medical department. On leaving college, the native graduates are employed as sub-assistant surgeons, on salaries ranging from sixty to 100 rupees per month, in the discharge of the duties of medical attendants in large dispensaries, estabhshed in different parts of the country. That the institution is well calculated to fulfil the objects proposed at its formation, and that the labour of the teachers"], [178, "154 MEDICAL college HOSPITAL. has not been thrown away upon the undeserving, have been amply proved by the result of the examinations which have annually taken place since November, 1838, for the purpose of granting diplomas. Practical proofs of the advantage and capabilities of the college have been given on each occa sion, and it can now be no longer doubtful that Hindoos are as able to master the difficulties of medical science as their European brethren. We might even go the length of saying that they possess capabilities superior to the European ; for the government having sent some of the students to England to study at the London University, one or two of them actu ally carried away the prizes from their English competitors. The complete success which has crowned the efforts of the professors must be a source of high gratification to them. Theirs is, indeed, a situation of which they may be proud. By the triumphal result of their exertions in developing the resources thus placed at their disposal, a new era in the science of medicine has commenced in India, The blessings of European medical knowledge are gradually extending over the land ; and the ignorant, chicaning empirics, who for so many years served the office of physicians in India, will be supplanted by a race of men who possess the requisite ability and scientific acquirement to treat disease with a reasonable prospect of success. At the same time, some of the most deeply- rooted prejudices of the native mind have been com pletely overthrown, and a new road has thus been opened for the progress of civilization in India. New Medical College Hospital. \u2014 This magnificent building, completed at a cost of 20,000_., is one of the finest architectural ornaments of the City of Palaces, as it is, be yond all comparison, the finest hospital in India. It is calcu lated to contain 500 beds, and with it will be incorporated the old Police Hospital and Infirmary for Eye Diseases, which have hitherto been conducted as separate establishments. One wing of the hospital will be appropriated to sick women and children, including the midwifery ward of the college ; and the most complete arrangements have been made for the comfort and accommodation of this class of patients. The building is divided into twenty-four wards, each capable of containing twenty-one patients. The wards are spacious and lofty, and arranged with clue regard to the most complete"], [179, "LA MARTINIERE. 155 and thorough ventilation. On the north side of the building, over the portico, is situated the council-room, a noble apart ment, of large dimensions ; and on the opposite or south side is the operating theatre, a room of nearly equal size, beautifully hghted from above by a large circular skylight of plate-glass. Immediately below the theatre, on the second floor, is the dispensary, another lofty and spacious apartment, with every convenience necessary for the pharmaceutical operations of the hospital. Every room in the building is plentifully supplied with water, by means of cast-iron pipes connected with four large iron cisterns on the roof, wliich are kept filled by a powerful forcing-pump, communicating with a tank in the vicinity. At the four corners of the building are constructed a series of closets and bathing-rooms, admirably adapted for the convenience of the sick. The wards are appropriately named after the principal donors and friends of the institution, including the members of the old Calcutta Municipal Committee, originated by Dr. J. R. Martin, Surgeon of the Native Hospital, in 1835, by whose zealous exertions a subscription was raised for the establish ment of a great central hospital in the city, and wliich has since served to form a nucleus for the funds necessary to the erection of the present. building. A large flight of stone steps leads to the great entrance on the second-floor, where there are two rooms, on either side, for the first reception of the sick. At the head of the staircase is a handsome stone tablet bearing an inscription. La Martinikre. \u2014 This magnificent institution was erected and is maintained by means of property bequeathed for the purpose by Major-General Claude Martine, whose name it bears. (See Lucknow.) The sum which General Martine set apart for endowing this noble charity was, as appears from the published extract of his will, 3,50,000 sicca rupees, but this having been placed at interest, had, in October, 1832, reached the amount of 9,62,825 sicca rupees, or nearly 100,000Z. sterling The pre cise objects of the charity were only indistinctly defined by the founder, while no attempt whatever was made by him to fix its internal economy. He acknowledges, indeed, in his will, that \" he is little able to make any arrangement for such an institution,\" and expresses a hope that either the govern-"], [180, "156 LA MARTINIERE. ment or the Supreme Court will devise the best insti for the pubhc good. The chief and almost the only specified by him in his brief reference to the subject ai it shall be for the good of the town of Calcutta ; that child ren of either sex shall be admissible to it, and, after b been educated, shall be apprenticed to some trade, or married ; that it shall bear the title of La Martiniere ; and that an inscription in large legible characters, bearing that it was established by him, shall be fixed on some part of the build ing. This vagueness of specification was probably the prin cipal reason why thirty-two years were allowed to elapse before any steps were taken to cany his benevolent design into effect. It ought to be mentioned to the honour of Bil Edward Ryan, formerly chief justice of the Supreme Court, that he, when second puisne judge, was the first who seri ously grappled with the difficulty, and that he drew np the decree, bearing date the 22nd October, 1832, in accon with which the rules and regulations of the institution were afterwards framed. In terms of this decree, the building was erected. It was completed on the 31st December, 1835, and thrown open for the reception of the wards on the 1st of March, 1836. The objects of La Martini, re, as appears from the pub lished rules, are twofold, viz. : \u2014 To provide gratuitous board, education, _fcc, to a certain number of indigent child . both sexes, and to furnish a superior education to boys in more favoured circumstances, who may be admitted either as boarders, day boarders, or day scholars, on the payment of a fixed monthly fee. The foundation children, fifty in number, are elected from the Christian population of Calcutta without respect to the religious denomination with which they are connected. They are selected on account of their indigent circumstances ; but the selection is made from those who are above the lowest class of the population, both because children of this class are amply provided for in the charitable institutions which already exist, and because, as is apprehended, the boarders and other scholars would not so readily or so harmoniously associate with them. The boys are eligible between the ages of four and ten years, and are allowed to remain till they reach the age of sixteen, though they may be apprenticed before that time with the approbation of the acting gover-"], [181, "157 LA MARTINIERE. nors ; the girls are eligible between the ages of four and twelve years, and unless they are apprenticed or married, they may remain for life. The education given to the founda tion children is of the most hberal and comprehensive cha racter. The boys are taught English, English grammar, writing, arithmetic, geography, the general outlines of history, particularly of the histories of Great Britain and British India, the Hindustani and Bengali languages, and the ele ments of mathematics, natural history, mechanical philo sophy ; and, in the case of any of them who discover superior talents, it is competent for the head master to instruct them in such additional branches as shah fit them for holding in after life a higher situation than that of apprentice to a trade. The girls, again, are educated in all the branches which have been specified, with the exception of mathematics and mecha nical philosophy, and are besides taught plain and ornamental needlework, knitting, and straw-plaiting. The boarders, day boarders, and day scholars are numerous. The inducements for parents to place their children there ai-e partly the superior character of the education imparted, and partly the comparatively cheap rate at which it is afforded. The greatest care is taken to avoid everything like an invidious distinction between them and the founda tion children. They take their meals at the same table and share the same fare, are taught in the same classes, when they have reached the same rate of progress, and associate in their play-hours. The only difference between them is, that they occupy separate dormitories, though these are equally spacious, well-aired, and commodious. The most distinctive circumstance connected with the internal arrangements of La Martiniere is the system of religious instruction which prevails in it. A general idea of this system may be gathered from the following resolu tion, which was unanimously adopted by the governors \u2014 as a compromise, it is understood, between two other views which almost equally divided them ; \u2014 \" that the pubhc religious instruction given to the children of the school be in conformity with the principles held in common by the English, Scotch, Roman, Greek, and Armenian churches ; but that the school be not placed under any particular deno mination of Christians, and that no points which are in"], [182, "158 LA MARTIN1ERE. controversy between the said churches be touched upon in the course of public instruction.\" A of religious instruction and a form of prayer for family devotional exer cises were framed in conformity with these principles by tho Protestant Bishop of Calcutta, the Roman Catholic prelate, and the principal Presbyterian minister. The plan recom mended by them and carried into operation consists of two parts, viz., the public religious instruction aud the private supplementary. In the former are embraced the funda mental truths of Christianity, as they are held by the five great existing divisions of Christendom enumerated in the resolution just cited. The private or supplementary religious instruction re lates to discipline, church government, the sacraments, and other matters on which differences more or less important exist, and is communicated by the ministers of different denominations, whom the parents or guardians of the respec tive children may select, and who attend at the school for the purpose. The fullest latitude is given to them in regard to the catechisms to be used by their respective classes, and doctrines, or tenets, to be imparted to them. The building of the institution, which is near the Circular Road, was commenced in June, 1833, and the entire edifice was completed in 1835. It cost about two lacs and Rs. 30,000, and is two-storied, with a large dome, which is employed as a library. Immediately under this \u2014 that is, in the centre of the building\u2014 is the chapel, on each side of which are the following accommodations for the children, viz., four large halls on each floor, making in all sixteen, employed as class-rooms, dormitory, and refectory. In addi tion to these, there are apartments (viz., two rooms on each floor, with an antechamber and conveniences) at each extre mity or wing of the building intended for the teachers. There are two porticos, north and south, both leading into the chapeL There are besides three rooms on the ground floor running the whole length of the south portico, the middle of which is the antechamber of the chapel, and the other two the domicile of one of the masters. Lastly, there are three rooms above these, two of which form the resi dence of one of the masters, and the third is the office of the secretary."], [183, "159 COLLEGES AND INSTITUTIONS. The Jesuits' College, in Park Street, was built for a theatre in 1841, hut the dispersal ofthe company of artistes by death and departure for England, and the pecuniary em barrassments of the theatre, caused the sale of the building to the Jesuits, who converted it into a college. Mechanics' Institution. \u2014 This is a small edifice of an oblong form, with a frontage resembling an Egyptian sar cophagus. It was built by subscription, with the view of inoculating the natives and the East Indians with a taste for mechanics. A few lectures were given by different gen tlemen, but the means of insuring a continuance of such services have latterly been wanting, and the institution now exists simply as a drawing-school. The Ochterlony Monument. \u2014 A column one hundred and sixty feet in height, with a Turkish capital and an Egyptian base. It stands on the esplanade in front of the town, and was erected to commemorate the pubhc worth of Major-General Sir David Ochterlony, who distinguished himself by his political and military services. The pillar is by no means an ornament to the town ; but it furnishes an opportunity to him who will be at the trouble of ascending by the circular staircase, of beholding from the summit an interesting panorama of Calcutta. The cost of the edifice was \u00a33,500. The Bengal Military Orphan Institution at Kidder pore, about two miles from Calcutta, is an ornament to the place, as much from the excellent and benevolent intentions of its founders, as from the beauty of its architecture. It was established to afford a home to the orphan children of officers and soldiers ; and as its affairs have always been managed by a select committee of officers, who have a bro therly interest in its success, it has been most prosperous. Children are not, however, merely housed, clothed, and educated ; their advancement in life is cared for, and sums varying according to circumstances are assigned as portions to girls marrving, or as premia to set boys forth in the world. The Presidency General Hospital. \u2014 The premises now denominated the General Hospital, were, in their original state, occupied as a garden-house by an individual, from whom they were purchased by the government in the year"], [184, "GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S INSTITUTION. 160 1768, and converted into an hospital. They were subsequently enlarged and surrounded by a wall, and now afford ample accommodation, in separate buildings, for patients and for the medical officers and establishment attached to the insti tution. The situation of the hospital is airy and healthy, and it is sufficiently far from the city without being incon veniently distant from Fort William, the soldiers from which are its principal inmates. Strictly speaking, the General Hospital is a military esta blishment, it having been transferred to the military depart ment in the year 1786, when the medical board was insti tuted ; but besides the sick of the European corps in garrison, on their first arrival from Europe, who are re. until their own regimental hospitals are prepared for them, the sick of European recruits, supernumeraries, and invalids of the Queen's and Company's army, the hospital is open for the reception of seamen belonging to her Majesty's or the Company's service, or to private and foreign ships, and also to European paupers. Nor, indeed, are Europeans in any other class of life refused admittance. To those who can afford to defray their own expenses, and for sick men belong ing to her Majesty's or the Company's ships or other _ a charge of one rupee per diem is made on account of each patient. The management of the hospital is conducted under the. fixed military regulations. The immediate charge of it is intrusted to a surgeon of the establishment, and two assis tant surgeons, who are permanently attached to it, and which latter reside on the' spot. The General Assembly's Institution, which stands on the outskirts of the city, on the road to Barra ckpore, was, as its title imports, founded at the instance of the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland, for the education and consequent conversion of the Hindoos. It is a plain but spacious and well-contrived building, arranged as a school, having large apartments for the purposes of instruction, illustration, &c, and quarters for the teachers. The mis sionaries of the Church of Scotland have the super intendence of the establishment, and their system is de servedly so popular, that there are seldom less than one"], [185, "ASIATIC SOCIETY. 161 thousand youths receiving education at one and the same time. The Great Jail is a large, airy, and healthy building, situated upon the eastern side of the race-ground.

There is a neat httle chapel within the jail, where service is performed by one of the government chaplains. The Asiatic Society's Rooms, Park-street. \u2014 The Asiatic Society of Bengal was instituted by Sir Wilham Jones, on the 15th January, 1784, during the administration of Mr. Warren Hastings, who became its first patron. The objects of inquiry, for which this noble society was created, were (to use the words of its distinguished founder) \" man and nature,\" or whatever is performed by the oue or produced by the other, confined within the geographical limits of Asia. On the 19th August, 1796, the first proposition was made to provide an edifice, the expenses of which were to be defrayed by entrance-fees of members, and by a quarterly subscription ; also by voluntary contributions ; and as the estimates for the present building are dated in 1806, it is probable that it was about that period erected. In 1839, the apartments being found too small for the proper display of the greatly-accumulating objects of natural history and other curiosities, two wings were added to it. A third outer apartment has since been added. There are now ten rooms of various sizes on the ground- floor, including the entrance-hall, in which are the stairs, and five on the upper. The grand or assembly-room extends from end to end of the building, which is very wide, with a fine verandah on its southern face. The museum contains many beautiful objects of natural history, chiefly birds, reptiles, and fishes. There are but few specimens of qua- drupeds. There is a fine collection of prepared skeletons of ' various animals ; such as the elephant, rhinoceros, camel, horse, ox, ass, tiger, bear, hog, &c.

There is a great collection of fragments of sculpture found in India, of various ages, the most remarkable objects amongst which are Budhist fragments, and some of Grecian origin. One in particular represents Silenus, supported by a group of well-executed figures, male aud female, but much mutilated. It was discovered at Muttra by Col The sculpture is divided into classes, viz. the Budhist, and Brahminical or Hindoo. In addition to the foregoing are various inscribed slabs, some of very great antiquity ; amongst these is a fragment of one of Asoka's pillars, brought from Delhi, which is upwards of two thousand years old, the deciphering of which will immortalize the name of James Prinsep, the late secretary to the society. In the upper apartments is a great variety of weapons of all Indian nations, and of the South-Sea Islander ; also many curious relics, musical instruments, &c. There is a fine gallery of pictures ; but few of these, however, belong to the society : they are merely deposited for exhibition and security's sake. The library is considered very valuable. Besides many hundred volumes of European publications in all languages, both modern and ancient, there is a fine collection of Oriental works, both printed and in manuscript : some of the latter are rare and of great value. There are also numerous volumes of Thibetan, Chinese, and Burman manuscripts ; the former are very curious, and chiefly printed in large characters with wooden blocks. In the hall are the portraits of Sir W. Jones, Mr. Colebrooke, aud Mr. H. H. Wilson, the works of Chantrey. The society holds its meetings every month. The foregoing comprise all the pubhc edifices, excepting the Mint and the churches, which have been raised for the purposes which they now fulfil. But they do not compre hend a tithe of the institutions which the philanthropy, the policy, the taste, and the ambition of Englishmen in India have, at different times, founded, and which now flourish, to the honour of the city of Calcutta, and the great advantage of India at large.

Considering the extent of the commercial community, the precarious tenure of human existence in Calcutta, and the necessity which a large proportion of the public is under of providing creditors with security against casualties, the number of Insurance Societies, though considerable, is not too great for the demand. There are but four whose opera tions are confined to life assurance. They are all profitable and substantial institutions, owing in a great measure to the diminished decadence of human life among the Europeans, and to what has been done to render the presidency of Bengal more salubrious, and to regulate diet and habits by climate. The Marine Insurance societies are about twelve in number ; two of these, the Union and the Alliance, confining themselves entirely to the assurance of boats and goods pro ceeding up the river Hooghly ; the remainder taking risks upon vessels and cargoes proceeding to all parts of the world. To most, if not to all of these latter offices, a marine sur veyor is attached, whose report of the condition of a vessel is generally taken before a policy is granted. The affairs of the societies are conducted by four or five directors, with a secretary, the latter office being generally held by a commer cial firm, who render accounts half-yearly.

The College of Fort William comprehends a class of examiners only, for it has ceased to offer a residence to the civil servants, who commence the study of the Persian and Bengalee languages on their arrival. The schools are for the most part devoted to the education of Eurasian, Arme nian, and English children, but three or four, conducted by natives, assisted by English masters, receive only Hindoo pupils. St. Xavier's College and the Loretto House are appropriated to the instruction of the Portuguese and Eura sian children of the Roman Catholic persuasion, though Protestants and others are admitted, and no attempt is made at proselytism. These last-named institutions are conducted by Jesuits and nuns, imported direct from the mother country. Bishop's College. \u2014 The first stone of Bishop's College was laid by Bishop Middleton, on the 15th of December, 1820, on a spot of ground presented by the government for the purpose, at the distance of about four miles from Cal cutta, on the opposite bank of the river, and immediately to the eastern extremity of the Honourable Company's Botanic Garden. Bishop's College is an elegant Gothic structure, of a quadrangular form, like most of the buildings of the same character in Oxford and Cambridge, but not joined at the angles, the southern side of the square being also open towards the river ; thus exhibiting the buildings of the northern side as the most conspicuous objects from the oppo site bank The northern side of the building is composed of a central tower, which is in height sixty-five feet ; in depth from east to west, thirty feet ; in depth from north to"], [190, "166 bishop's college. south, twenty-four feet. The right or western side of this tower is occupied by a building of equal depth, but whose height is but forty feet, and its length from BMt to west sixty feet, the ground floor of which is the hall. Tho upper floor is the library of the college. The left, or eastern side of the central tower, is occupied by the chapel, a building of the same dimensions with the pre ceding, but in every other respect altogether dissimilar ; being, of course, a single compartment, with an arched roof; in its exterior figure and decorations approaching to a minia ture resemblance of that superb structure King's College Chapel, in Cambridge. The ground-floor of the central tower forms an entrance both to the chapel and the hall ; the first floor is the vestibule of the library, communicating also with the organ-loft of the chapel ; the second floor is the council-room, or visitors' chamber, and opens to the terraced roof of the library. The two wings, extending from north to south to the length of 150 feet (equal to that of the northern side described above), are allotted to the residence of professors, pupils, and domiciliaries. The edifice cost about 13,000.. The college is founded for a principal and two other pro fessors from the Enghsh universities, and as many students as can, be maintained, either on the proper foundation of the Incorporated Society, or on the endowment of any other religious society of the Established Church, or of the local governments, or individuals. The students are educated either as missionaries for the extension of Christianity in its present form, and in the mode of ancient discipline and order which is alone recognised by the Church of England, or as schoolmasters for the dissemination of general and useful knowledge. The District Charitable Society is a noble institution. It owes its origin to the benevolent and zealous exertions of the late Bishop Turner. At the period of its organization, the distribution of the public charitable funds was chiefly intrusted to the select vestry of St. John's Cathedral ; but as the city had greatly enlarged its dimensions, and much difficulty was experienced in determining who were proper objects of public bounty, committees were formed in the different districts, with power to form sub-committees and"], [191, "167 agricultural society. appoint visitors and inspectors. The system has worked admirably. Many hundreds of destitute people of all classes, colours, and castes, are now liberally relieved from the ample resources of the society, which have progressively augmented through the spontaneous bounty of many individuals of rank and worth ; at the head, however, of whom long stood the well-known and esteemed Dwarkanauth Tagore. Almshouses and the leper establishment have been formed from the funds of the District Charitable Society. The Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India. \u2014 This institution was founded by the late Rev. W. Carey, D.D., who directed attention to the benefits hkely to arise from the united efforts of a society, in an address from Mission-House, Serampore, dated 15th April, 1820, which was circulated, and followed up by a meeting at the Town- Hall on the 14th September of the same year. On that occasion the names of thirty-two individuals were enrolled as members, under the patronage of the Marquis of Hastings and Lady Hastings ; and the following among other resolutions were passed : \u2014 \" That a society be formed, to be denominated ' The Agri cultural Society of India,' of which the following rules should form the basis : \"That the promotion of horticulture in India be con sidered as a branch of its main object. \" That gentlemen of every nation be eligible as members ; and that all members, after the formation of the society, be admitted by ballot of a majority of the members then present. \" That gentlemen in every part of India be requested to communicate their observations upon the cultivation of the different districts in which they reside, pointing out their merits or defects, and suggesting those improvements which may occur to them. \" That the transactions of the society be published in English, and in two, at least, of the languages of India, as often as a sufficient quantity of information be collected.\" The society in its primitive state, devoted its attention and means almost exclusively to horticulture, by awarding medals and high pecuniary rewards to the most successful native gardeners, who were required to give evidence of the"], [192, "168 botanical gardens. locality of their ground, and the extent of cultivation. As a further encouragement, seeds were imported from England and other parts, at the expense of the society, and distributed gratis to those who undertook to cultivate vegetables for the Calcutta market. These measures were attended with very successful results ; the natives zealously competed for the prizes, and a sur prising improvement soon became visible in cauliflower, cab bage, pease, and most of the principal vegetables of England. From that period to the present, amidst many changes and vicissitudes, the society has gone on increasing its utility, the number of it3 members, and the amount of its funds, and India owes to it3 exertions the introduction of many of the staples of other countries, and the evolvement of the products of a soil unrivalled for its richness. Cotton from American seed, flax from New Zealand seed, sugar cane from Otaheitan plantations, tobacco, silk, <tc., have been largely produced under the auspices of the society ; and in many parts of India it has conduced to the improvement of the machinery and implements in use among planters and husbandmen. In connection with the Agricultural and Horticultural Society, we may notice The Botanical Gardens. \u2014 It is now about half a century since the late General Kyd, of the BeDgal Engineers, who chanced to be a great personal favourite of the then Soobadar of Bengal, that \" Paradise of Nations,\" as one of the emperors entitled it, was presented by his highness with the extensive ground on the right bank of the flooghly, about four miles seaward from the city, which now forms the gardens. Kyd was a man of refined taste and scientific acquirement, and especially delighted in horticultural and agricultural pursuits ; an inclination which he encouraged, not merely because of his innate love for the study, but in the philanthropic anxiety to improve a country of which he beheld the great capabilities very much neglected. In this spirited and laudable excite ment, he began by expending large sums of money in laying out and clearing the jungly and obstructed ground ; hiring and (which required both skill and patience) instructing native gardeners, and procuring plants from all parts of India, China, and other immediately accessible countries;"], [193, "botanical gardens. 169 and in the year 1793, having advanced his project sufficiently to demonstrate its feasibility, he recommended the Company's government (Sir John Shore being Governor-General) to occupy the ground as a public botanical garden, and disin terestedly offered it to them, on condition that it should be accepted as a free gift from himself, and perpetually appro priated to the purposes in question. He farther stipulated for the introduction and cultivation of everything that could tend to the agricultural improvement of the land, as distinct from what is implied in the mere botanical branch of the general undertaking ; and his offer was accepted by the Government on the terms and in the spirit in which it was laid before them. They immediately sent round to Madras for Dr. Roxburgh, then high in the medical service of that presidency, and justly celebrated for his acquirements as a botanist, and placed him in charge, as \"superintendent\" of the gardens, on a munificent, but not an extravagant, salary of 1,500 rupees per mensem, and built for him a mag nificent residence, such as the climate and situation required, which, originally of but two stories high, though covering what in England would be deemed a very large surface, he was eventually authorized to raise another story, as it was considered of importance that he should constantly reside there, and as the locality was deemed unhealthy in the rainy season, especially when there was no such advantage as a high and airy dwelling. Dr. Roxburgh forthwith set to work (with the skill and diligence of one who understood and took pleasure in his vocation), cutting, grafting, plant ing, and otherwise furthering and perfecting the object had in view by bis appointment, and in a short time laid the foundation of what may be termed the richest garden in the world, spoken with reference to such of the produce of the earth as does not require artificial cultivation. In Europe, the deficiencies, and even positive hostility of climate, are supplied or baffled, as the case demands, by buildings, of which the temperature is, without much difficulty, regulated, by scientific appliances, throughout the year ; whereas, in India there are no adequate means of overcoming similar difficulties ; and hence a greater degree of credit is due to the successful endeavours of the practical Indian botanist. The Supreme Government allowed for the general pur-"], [194, "170 BOTANICAL GARDENS. poses of the establishment about 1,600 rupees (then equal to 200?. sterling) a month ; and continued that rate down to the year 1830, when it fell, like many other efficient and creditable establishments, under the indiscrimiuating aud most injurious economical fervour of Lord William Bentinck, and was reduced to within 1,100, which has crippled it exceedingly. Dr. Roxburgh died in 1813, and his fro Dtda erected a monument to his memory about ten years subse quently \u2014 in 1823. This memorial is composed of Chunar stone, a very durable material, and bears an elegant Latin inscription, and is in the form of a truncated column, sur mounted by an urn, a favourite monumental ornament of Anglo-Indians. In 1837, his son, Captain Roxburgh, ofthe Company's military service, with filial piety, caused a very chaste and elegant structure, somewhat in the style of a Grecian temple, to be erected over it, so as to at once protect and adorn the monument ; and the whole now forms an object of great beauty, and attracting ornament in the gar dens \u2014 its very appropriate locality. On the death of Dr. Roxburgh, the celebrated H. T. Colebrooke was nominated to the temporary charge of the post, till Dr. Francis Hamilton should be enabled to assume the office. This justly-celebrated naturalist and extraordinary man (Hamilton) remained but a few years in a situation which his genius so well qualified him to improve and to adorn, when he was necessitated by an impaired constitution to return to England ; and was succeeded by Dr. Nathaniel Wallich, of whom it is but bare justice to say, that he was a worthy successor of those great precursors. General Kyd died soon after the munificent donation which he made of the garden to the state. A monument to his memory stands opposite the principal river-entrance to the garden, at the termination of an avenue of sissoo-trees (one of the staple timbers of India) which leads through a plantation of teak, the extremity of which, reaching the river, is faced by the famous dockyard, on the opposite hank, built and for a series of years conducted by his son, the excellent and accomplished James Kyd. This monument, the work of Bacon, is of marble, and typifies the agricultural taste and philanthropic purposes of him whom it is designed to commemorate."], [195, "sailor's home. 171 The Botanical Garden, although by no means as liberally sustained by the government as its importance deserves, is nevertheless of great utility in multiplying the higher classes of vegetable produce, and in supplying a nursery for exotics of all descriptions. The natives of India have of late years directed their attention most assiduously to the practice of English agriculture as illustrated by the garden system. They constantly apply for plants and seeds, which are furnished gratis ; and we have it on the best authority, that in one year only (not selected as a remarkable one), 16,000 plants were distributed among 300 applicants, of ah classes, and in all parts of the country ; besides 42,000 tea-plants raised in the garden for Assam. But for the existence of the garden, Indian horticulture would know no advancement ; for there could be no private nurseries of efficiency formed in India as there are in England, and therefore, if the government did not uphold a pubhc one, the art of cultivation would remain almost barbaric. To the new arriver in India, male or female, the Botanic Gardens will afford unalloyed pleasure, as often as they can be visited, and especially between the months of October and April ; but at any time of the year, rather than they should not be visited at all. The beauty of their site, the grandeur of their extent, the perfectness of their order, the magnificence of their trees, the very life that is in them, and which Enghsh gardeners encourage not, birds, squirrels, and so forth \u2014 and the feeling of buoyant pleasure in the escape from the town, with a delightful party ; all these elements of pleasure combine to make a day passed there, but especially a day in December, January, or February, a day to be always remembered in an exile's life, when he shall be far out of the reach of a repetition of the enjoyment. The Sailor's Home. \u2014 This institution has been in exist ence since July, 1837. Its object was to suppress crimping, and all the evils arising from it, to which owners, com manders, officers, and crews of vessels, were subject in the port of Calcutta. This object was sought to be attained, by providing board and lodging for the officers and crews, cashing their advance-notes, supplying slops of the best materials, and at the lowest rate, and affording a safe place of deposit for the savings of seamen during their stay in"], [196, "172 HOSPITALS axd associations. Calcutta. We believe that the institution has in many instances realized the purposes for which it was formed. The Medical and Physical Society was formed for the purpose of promoting intercourse among medical men. Meetings are held once a month, where questions interesting to the faculty are discussed, and papers on remarkable cases read and recorded. The papers are afterwards published in a volume. The Public Library was established at the instance of the author of this \" Hand-Book,\" with the view of affording to the town the advantages of a library of reference and a circulating library. Numerous donations of books, maps, &c. formed a nucleus, and regular subscriptions and pro prietary pr\u0153mia have since contributed to enrich the insti tution. The Native Hospital, as its title imports, affords relief to indigent natives afflicted with disease or encountering accidents. About one hundred patients, male and female, are generally found within its walls. The establishment is supported partly by government, and partly by the interest upon bequests, and charitable donations. The Police Hospital is somewhat of the same character. The General Hospital and the Howrah Seamen's Hospital afford medical treatment and an asylum to sick seamen of the navy or merchant service ; but the former, as the larger establishment, and enjoying government sup port, receives soldiers whose regiments are not part of the garrison of Fort William, and poor Europeans of all de scriptions. The Chamber of Commerce is a sort of court of arbitra tion, when disputes arise among mercantile men. It like wise forms a channel of communication between the govern ment and the trading community, and otherwise aids the merchants to act in concert upon points involving a common interest. The Trade Association serves, among tradesmen and shopkeepers, the purposes wliich the Chamber of Commerce effects for the higher classes of commercial men. The Trade Association was originally formed to check the system of nnlimited credit which had filled the books of shopkeepers"], [197, "173 THE ARSENAL. with bad debts ; and it is only just to say that it has worked to a good and useful end. Besides the public establishments mentioned above, there are several of vast importance which belong exclusively to the government, and others the property of private com panies ; but as they have no peculiarly attractive exterior, they have not been classed with the buildings. These are \u2014 the Arsenal of Fort Wilham and the Cossipore Foundry, the Docks of Kidderpore and Howrah, the Gloster Mills, &c. The A_rsenal. \u2014 The foundations of Fort William, as we have elsewhere said, were laid during Lord Clive's govern ment, immediately after the battle of Plassy, in the year 1757. We cannot tell when the fortifications were act ually completed. The Fort mounts 619 guns of various calibres, from twelve to thirty-two-pounders, exclusive of mortars, viz. : \u2014 the bastions and redans, 205 ; flanks of bastions, eighty-nine ; redoubts, ravelins, and counter-guards, 197 ; lunettes, 122 ; and feussebraie, six. The area within the Arsenal buildings is nearly a square, being 234 feet by 232. The dimensions of the room set apart for the armoury are 315 feet long by sixty feet wide, and it contains about 60,000 stand of fire-arms and 20,000 swords. The store-rooms are extensive, and contain large quantities of camp equipage, intrenching-tools, saddlery for cavalry, horse-artillery harness, elephant harness, small-arm equipments, together with different descriptions of stores required for engineering, fitting out ordnance for land and sea service, &c, as well as various descriptions of tools and materials required by artificers in the different departments, and for the supply of field- magazines and depots at out-posts ; besides which there are sheds containing a supply of field and siege gun-carriages, which are ready for service at a moment's notice. Attached to the Arsenal there is a work yard, called the Artificer's Bankshall, in which there are at present thirty forges constantly at work. The gunpowder magazines of Fort Wilham are all bomb-proof, and, inde pendent of the Grand Magazine, are made to contain some-"], [198, "174 THE COSSIPORE FOUNDRY. thing more than 5,000 barrels, or 500,000 pounds of powder. There are, also, branch or expense magazines in the outworks, also bomb-proof, to hold 200 barrels each. So large a quan tity, however, is not deposited within the Fort, the principal depots being at Duckinsore and Pultah, situated on the left bank of the river, above Calcutta ; the former at the distance of eight and the latter seventeen miles. The Grand Maga zine is appropriated entirely to the reception of small-arm ammunition, and, as before stated, is not included among those (four in number) intended for powder in barrels. The proportion of ready-made small-arm ammunition lodged in the Grand Magazine is 1,200,000 rounds. The ordnance-yards generally contain, independent of the guns mouuted on the works, between 3,000 and 4,000 pieces of iron and brass ordnance, including many heavy mortars. The quantity of shot and shell for the different calibres seldom falls short of 1,800,000 rounds, ready-prepared grape and case shot included, but exclusive of more than 14,000,000 loose shot, of various diameters, for grape and canister. The Cossipore Foundry. \u2014 This large and important establishment \u2014 one of the most complete and perfect to be seen in any country, erected some years since by Colonel Hutchinson of the Engineers, after he had ransacked Eng land and Europe for the best models \u2014 is situated upon the banks of the Hooghly, at Cossipore, about four miles above Calcutta, and presents a chaste and simple facade of the Tuscan order, 178 feet in length. On ascending a flight of steps, the entry is into the instrument-room, in which are arranged the various boring-bars, bits, and knives, &c, used in the process of boring and turning the ordnance. Here is also preserved a model of the old boring machinery of four lathes, wrought by bullocks, forming a striking contrast with the present extensive and beautisid steam machinery. Right and left of the instrument-room is a suite of rooms for the office, model, and pattern department, &c. Adjoining and extending along the whole length of those rooms is a magnificent boring- room, 170 feet long by fifty feet wide, and forty feet high, lighted by numerous elevated windows, throwing a strong and steady hght upon the work to be executed. The roof of this room has been much admired for its lightness and novelty, being formed of iron"], [199, "175 DOCKS, ship-building, etc. trusses, covered with planks and copper sheathing. Down the east side of the room is arranged the beautiful mill work and machinery, sent out by the Hon. Court, consisting of twelve boring and turning lathes for ordnance, divided into two parts, which can be worked either together or separately by two small steam-engines in adjoining rooms. Down the west side a range of lighter lathes has been put up for all the small miscellaneous work which the foundry has now to execute. The ordnance boring and twining lathes are of an entirely novel self-acting principle, by which the piece of ordnance is turned as well as bored by the machinery itself ; an inven tion which reduces the amount of manual labour two-thirds, whilst it insures a greater accuracy of the line of metal. On the north and south of the boring-room are the rooms for the vice-men, carpenters, and finishing departments. The water for the supply of the steam-engines is brought from a tank in another yard, at a distance of more than 200 feet, by means of a siphon of five-inch bore made in the soundly, which is believed to be the first instance known of a siphon having been successfully used upon so large a scale. At a short distance from the boring-room, connected by a covered passage, is situated the casting or smelting-house, furnished with cupola blast-furnaces for the smelting of iron, of which a good deal is now manufactured in the foundry, and the large reverberatory furnaces for the smelting of the gun-metal, in the construction of which a great improve ment has been made, the metal being now smelted in about half the time formerly required in the usual description of air-furnaces. Adjoining the smelting-house are the moulding sheds and blacksmiths' department, together with other store-rooms, forming a spacious square inclosure around the principal building. The Docks, Ship-Building, &c. \u2014 In India, ship-building for foreign voyages was scarcely known until the settlement in it of Europeans, under whom it made great progress ; the architectural parts being supplied by them, and the principal part of the manual labour performed by native artificers, under the instructions of the former, as in the present day. Prior to the year 1780, Bengal was almost entirely de pendent on Surat, Bombay, Demaun, and Pegue, for shipping."], [200, "176 religions edifices. The earliest specimen of a regular Calcutta-built ship was produced in the year 1781, and named the Nonsuch, measur ing 483 tons, and so constructed as to answer as a vessel of war, or a merchant ship : she was lost while heaving into dock at Sulkea, in 1802. From 1781 to 1800, twenty-seven ships, measuring 14,714 tons, were built at Calcutta. From 1801 to 1821, there were built at Calcutta and adjacent to it, 223 ships, measur ing 101,908 tons. Since the last-mentioned period, ship-building has greatly declined in Bengal. This is accounted for by an increased influx of ships from Great Britain, in consequence of the free trade ; which ships are for the most part constructed and sailed at a cheaper rate than ships built in India, and manned with lascars. The first dry dock constructed at Calcutta was a small one at the Bankshall, in 1790, for the government pilot vessels ; subsequent to which, several large docks were built at Howrah and Sulkea; in 1803, the Kidderpore dock was founded. Previous to the construction of these dry docks, ships were hove down at Calcutta when their bottoms required repair. Since the formation of the Strand Road, shipbuilding has been confined, with the exception of the extensive dockyard at Kidderpore, belonging to the Joint Stock Company, to the western side of the river, at Howrah and Sulkea ; at either of these places ships and vessels, of different descrip tions and magnitude, may at all times be seen in the various stages of completion, and others in dock undergoing repair. Religious Edifices. \u2014 With the list of these we shall complete the enumeration of all the public establishments and edifices in Calcutta. The Cathedral (St. Paul's), erected at an expense of 50,000.-, at the instance of Bishop Wilson \u2014 (opened in October, 1847), the Old Cathedral (St. John's), the Scotch Church, the Old (mission) Church, St. James's Church, the Free School, or St. Thomas's Church, the Scotch Free Church, St. Peter's Church (Fort William), a pretty Gothic building, with a beautiful painted window, St. Thomas's Church, Howrah, the Catholic Cathedral, the Roman Cathohc Church (Durrunitollah), the Roman Cathohc Church (Boitaconnah),"], [201, "TRADERS, SHOPKEEPERS, ETC 177 the Greek Church, the Armenian Church of Calcutta, the Loll Bazaar Baptist Chapel, the Circular-road Baptist Chapel, the Independent Union Chapel (Durrumtollah), the Hindos tanee Church, the Simlah Church (about two miles from Calcutta, where a converted and ordained Hindoo officiates), the Mahomedan Mosque (in Durrumtollah), the Orphan Refuge Church, on the left bank of the Hooghly. Such is an outline of the prominent pubhc features of the metropolis of British India. Of what concerns the private life of the residents much has been said in the portion of this work appropriated to a description of society, social habits, and domestic expenditure ; but much remains to be told of the minor features of Calcutta, which have more or less a bearing upon civilized existence. It is difficult to classify them, or arrange them in any particular natural order; they are, therefore, given in the sequence in which they occur to us. Traders, Shopkeepers, &c. \u2014 Some idea may be formed of the quantity of business done in Calcutta, and of the extent to which the wants of civilized residents are supplied, from the following list of people in trade, &c, within the town : \u2014 Of houses of agency there are 128. Commission-agents, eighteen. Corn and oil millers, three. Greek merchants, four. Jew merchants, sixteen. Mogul merchants, eighteen. Armenian merchants, fifteen. Arab merchants, eleven. Parsee merchants, seven. Banian merchants, eight. Prin cipal Hindostanee shroffs, twenty-eight. Principal Bengalee shroffs, fourteen. Native agents and ship captains' Banians, twenty-five. There are fifteen presses (Enghsh), besides others of inferior note, with five native presses. There are, also, six English hthographic presses, not including those worked by natives. Almost all the presses execute copper plate printing. There are two circulating libraries. Of booksellers, six, with many native. Of bookbinders, four, with many native. Of seal and gem engravers, two. Of paper-manufactories, three. Of public auctions, seven. Of house and land registry offices, one. Of silk and indigo marts, three. Of bakers, eight, with many native.

Of leather-manufacturers, five. Of undertakers and stonemasons, eight. Steam Machinery. \u2014 Formerly the exportation of machi nery from Great Britain was prohibited ; but for some years past, articles of this nature have been freely imported into India. Steam-engines of different powers, with all their appurtenances, and various other machinery imported from Great Britain, for the manufacture of sugar, oil, saltpetre, paper, and other purposes, are now procurable in Calcutta at reasonable prices. The Bengal government set the first example of introducing extensive machinery, in the erection of the New Mint at Calcutta, which is filled with the best specimens of the skill and genius of Watt."], [203, "179 SPORTS OF CALCUTTA. The first steam-engine set up in Bengal (it is believed) was that on the bank of the river, at Chaundpaul ghaut, for the purpose of raising water from the Hooghly, to lay the dust of some of the principal streets of the city contiguous to the Government-House. The fluid passes from the engine well into a large brick-built reservoir, and from it into aque ducts constructed on one side of the road. On approaching Calcutta, the smoking chimneys of steam-engines are now seen in every direction, on either side of the river, presenting the gratifying appearance of a set of numerous extensive manufactories, vying with those in many British cities. The Electric Telegraph has lately been introduced into Calcutta, and keeps up communication between that city and Diamond Harbour. It will soon be spread over India, for forty Europeans have been sent out to assist Professor O'Shaughnessy, the superintendent, in laying down lines throughout the Presidency. The Sports of Calcutta \u2014 The English have been famous throughout the civilized world for carrying with them, as the snail does his shell, their own country sports and amuse ments ; nor does the City of Palaces, despite all obstacles of climate, form an exception to the general rule. Accordingly, Calcutta can boast of its race-course and its hunt ; cricket, archery, and rackets also have their votaries ; and regattas occasionally enliven the banks of the Hooghly. The first record of the existence of racing in Calcutta may be dated from the origin of the Bengal Jockey Club, in 1808, from which time, until the cessation, caused by the general stagnation of everything, owing to the great failures in the year 1832, there were annual race-meetings in December of each year, a continuation of which was held at Barrackpore, in January following. In 1832, however, they entirely ceased, until then regeneration in 1836, since which period one, and in some instances a second, meeting has been held annually. The race-course itself forms part of the esplanade surrounding the glacis of Fort Wilham, and is adorned with a handsome race-stand, where, on a cold race-morning in January, the beauty and fashion of Calcutta delight to congregate, and around wliich the motley groups may vie in point of singu larity, though not in number, with Epsom on a Derby day. The wealthy Hindoos in their carriages, and the stately, n 2"], [204, "180 CALCUTTA RACES. sedate-looking Mussulmaun, are alike present to view the tumaslia, as it is called : strange contrasts indeed are there, as in one corner may be seen the sliin, wasted fonn of a Newmarket jockey, elbowing a fat ghee-fed. Baboo ; in another, the grandson of Tippoo Saib conversing familiarly with the owner of a favourite. The races, like other amusements in the East, commence at sunrise ; and unless retarded by the fogs, wliich occasion ally during the cold season envelope the whole plain until dispersed by the sun's rays, are usually over by ten o'clock ; thus enabling all classes, from the Governor-General to the sircar, to attend and enjoy the sport without trenching upon their daily avocations, \u2014 a circumstance which, in a place where none are idle, contributes mainly to the support of the turf In former years, racing was discountenanced by the higher authorities, even to such an extent that any servant of government engaged in the turf was compelled to adopt a iwm de guerre, to prevent his being a marked man ; and so it remained until the administration of Sir Charles Metcalfe, who, with that liberality extended alike to all classes, took off the ban, and in the year 1835-36 the handsome gift of a piece of plate by the Governor-General was announced. This example was annually followed by Sir Charles's successor, Lord Auckland, who, with his family, made a point of attending the races. Since 1842, however, when Lord Auckland returned to England, the races have enjoyed but little of the patronage of the Governor-General. Lords Ellenborough, Hardinge, and Dalhousie seldom remained for any length of time in Calcutta \u2014 and they were, during then stay in India, chiefly engrossed by the wars of Scinde, Gwalior, the Punjab, and Burmah. The class of horses most generally employed on the turf is the Arab, of which numbers are annually imported from the Persian Gulf to Bombay, and thence to Madras and Calcutta. Their chief characteristic as race-horses is their bottom and powers of endurance, rather than actual speed, rendering them peculiarly adapted for the description of races in vogue in Calcutta, which are seldom less than two miles, and often extend to three-mile heats. Of imported English cattle, there are but few specimens, but little encouragement being held out for their importation, as a"], [205, "181 HORSE-BREEDING. succession of years has proved them so superior with any weights or distances to any other class of horse in the coun try, that competition with the slightest chance of success is nearly useless. From the Cape of Good Hope, horses are also occasionally imported, though very rarely with sufficient success to warrant repetition of the experiment. New South Wales has also furnished a few competitors, and from the general progression of all matters in that colony, it appears probable that India will be indebted to it for horses inferior only to the imported English. The breeding of horses in an Indian climate for turf purposes has been attempted iu various instances by private individuals, though with very rare success ; the transitory nature of the residence of gentlemen in that country being obviouslyopposed to the success of an undertaking which, to bring it to perfection in the Indian climate, would consume many years ; the necessity also for constant renewal of the blood, whether English or Arab, without which the breed degenerates into weeds, renders the affair expensive, while its necessary tediousness forbids hope of reimbursement within a reasonable time. From the government studs of Haupper, Ghazeepore, <fec, horses occasionally make their appearance on the turf, though from the impurity of the blood, which is never pure through more than three gene rations, they generally fail in endurance, though instances have been seen of extraordinary speed, for short distances. The uncertainty of temper, of which all horses bred in the country more or less partake, is also against them. Maugre all these obstacles, a large breeding-stud was maintained for a considerable period by Mr. Sawers (a gentleman of the medical service), though not with the success so enthusiastic a votary of the sport of the tin's deserved ; this gentleman having regularly run horses both at Calcutta and in the provinces for thirty years. Hunting, properly so called, on the footing of fox-hunting in England, is, though a complete exotic in the East, exten sively pursued throughout India. Every large station, whether in Bengal itself or the Upper Provinces, usually boasts its pack of hounds. To the \"Calcutta hunt,\" however, the palm of superiority has been awarded, both from the better adaptation of the country about Calcutta for hunting,"], [206, "182 THE CALCUTTA HUNT. and from the style in jvhich the hunt-club is maintained. The hunt itself has existed since the year 1820, and is com posed and managed, hke the turf, exclusively by amateurs. The kennels, situated at Alipore, the southern suburb of Calcutta, both in convenience, extent, and a]y might vie with the best in the mother-country : thirty couples of hounds, selected from the draughts of the best kennels in England, are annually imported at a cost of 20O to 250 rupees (twenty to twenty-five pounds) per couple ; the management is vested in a committee of three gentlemen, with the usual adjuncts of huntsmen, a gentleman selected from the club, aud secretary. The hunting season commences in November, and is considered to end iu April ; but during the first month of the rainy season, June, the pack regularly meet. It would surprise the denizens of the chase in England, who proceed leisurely to the eleven o'clock meet, to hear that their brethren in the East conclude their day's sport ere theirs is begun. Such, however, is the fact : the chase-loving Anglo- Indian rises by candlelight, drives himself to cover, either at Dum Dum or Gowripore, a distance of eight or nine miles, where the hounds having also performed their journey in a spring van, throw off at sunrise, half-past five, and probably finish their second jackal by nine o'clock, returning home to breakfast by ten. The substitute for the English fox is the jackal \u2014 somewhat larger in size, and when fairly put to a stretch, nowise inferior in speed ; his nature too is similar, as he partakes of the love for poultry so strongly displayed in his English prototype. The country, technically so called, consists of plains or generally cultivated gardens, raised to avoid the inundation consequent on the rainy season ; jungles of bamboos densely planted, in which the Indian village is situated, and which require no small skill on the part of the rider to hounds to thread when going the pace. The fences chiefly comprise bank, or rather mud-wall, \u2014 a kind of raised embankment usually from three to sour feet high, with large ditches on either side, \u2014 being the boundaries of the n tive gardens, \u2014 or bamboo-rails, ' about the height of an English sheep-hurdle ; and almost the only drawback to Eastern hunting is the frequency of patches of jungle, which occasion either a check or a change of jackal ; and the diffi culties of pushing the jackal through the villages, unless tha"], [207, "FIELD SPORTS. 183 hounds be close at his brush, frequently mar the best pro spects of a run. Horses of all descriptions make their appearance at the course side, from the little wiry Arab to the imported hunter ; and it is frequently found that the former is the better adapted to a country where the ground is occasionally of the consistency of baked bricks, than the latter, whose feet were never meant to lie battered ; for this reason, the hght weights usually have the best of it, and the pluck of the little Arab, which carries him over ditches large enough to engulf him self, rider and all, cannot be too much admired. The breeding of hounds, though attended with some success on the hills, has been found quite impracticable in Calcutta ; and indeed there would appear to be something in the climate inimical to the very constitution of the Enghsh fox-hound, as it is with difficulty their live3 are preserved through the hot and rainy season ; and it seldom happens that out of the previous years' importation nine or ten couples remain to greet their new brethren on their arrival. That terrible scourge the dil-i-baz, or palpitation of the heart, makes great havoc ; diseased liver is also among the frequent curses of the kennel, inso much that those hounds which may, by dint ofthe apothecary's shop, bring their blue-pilled carcases to the cover side, after the second season in India, never manifest the dash and eagerness by which the English fox- hound is so pre-eminently distinguished. , All field sports, with the exception, of course, of tiger hunting, (fee, may be attained easily at a short distance from Calcutta \u2014 hog-hunting parties frequently beset the jungles at Budge Budge. Capital snipe-shooting may be had by crossing the Hooghly, at almost any time of the year ; and by going a couple of days' journey into the country, the determined sportsman may meet with plenty of buffaloes, and taste the sweets of an encounter with a leopard. Fish ing, save angling in the tanks preserved by wealthy natives, exists not in or about Calcutta : \u2014 no purling streams contain trout, and the best fish, the \" rooe,\" is caught much in the same fashion as carp and tench in England. The cricket and racket clubs are both most popular in Calcutta ; the former amusement is pursued regularly throughout the cold season, i.e. from October to April \u2014 and a very promising"], [208, "184 HOTELS AND CLUBS. eleven can be mustered when the duties of office will permit ; indeed, such as would do no discredit to Lord's and the Marylebone. The ground appropriated to cricket is also part of the esplanade, parallel with the river Hooghly, and is kept in excellent order. Every cold-weather evening, during the drive, may be seen the practice going on, i. e. master hitting and bowling, and blackey fagging. The native hohdays afford time to the amateurs for playing matches, which constantly take place with the Dum Dum and Chinsurah elevens : they are usually well contested, the rival eleven chiefly consisting of officers and private soldiers of the artillery or Queen's regiments ; and it must be a poor regiment that cannot muster an eleven : failing these adversaries, the Civil Service or the Etonians versus the Calcutta Club furnish materials for a contest. The Racket Club, as may be supposed, consists but of a hmited number of members, and the game is played the whole year round, during the hot season and rains (when dry enough) in the afternoon, and during the cold season, early in the morning. The court is situated at the end of the Chowringhee Road, and is divided into two separate courts to the east and west, commodious and in good order. Regattas, or other rowing matches, between the boats' crews of the different vessels in the port, frequently take place during the cold weather, and the monotony of the evening drive is varied by the contest. The immense strength of the current in the Hooghly renders it unfitted for rowing parties, notwithstanding there have been crews formed both for pulsing and sailing, though the amusement has never attained general popularity. Hotels and Hotel Charges. \u2014 There are several hotels in Calcutta, the first of which are Spence's and Thb Auckland. The charges in all are pretty much alike, the difference in economy being generally attended by a material difference in comfort. The expense of living does not exceed ten pounds (100 rupees) per mensem, which includes a bed room, and three meals per diem at the table d'hote, not including wines, &c. Bengal Club-House. \u2014 There is a handsome establishment under this denomination in the Chowringhee-road. Gentlemen are elected by baUot ; and the entrance and annual subscrip tion entitle them to occupy rooms, to take their meals, play"], [209, "185 PUBLIC CONVEYANCES. cards or billiards, read newspapers, <fec. Of course, separate payments are made for the use of the apartments and for the different refections. The subscriptions, &c, cover house rent, furniture, servants' wages, breakage, purchase of books, periodicals, newspapers, <fec. The house is elegantly furnished, and the best male society is met within its walls. Public Conveyances. \u2014 The public conveyances of Cal cutta consist of palankeens, barouches, chariots, britskas, buggies, palankeen carriages, &c, all of which may be had for hire. The Teeka (or public) palankeens are under the control of the magistracy, who have regulated the rates of hire and settle aU disputes. The other vehicles are procura ble from the various livery-stable keepers, and cost from one to two guineas (ten to twenty rupees) per day. Boats. \u2014 Wherries, or dinghies, manned by two rowers and a steersman, are to be found in numbers at all the wharfs ; they are of a slight construction, spoon-bottomed, with a circular awning of bamboo-work, under which a person can sit ; and though in general well managed, are by no means to be considered safe conveyances. They are used for going off to the shipping or across the river, and the usual fare for a European is an anna, equal to three-halfpence ; but if to return or wait for the party, from two to four annas are considered reasonable ; all depending on time. For trips up and down the river, within a day or two's journey of Calcutta, bavleahs and budgerows are to be had at all times. These have been elsewhere described. Coolies. \u2014 In every street are to be found coolies, or porters, who carry burdens on their heads, however light or heavy the load may be, provided it do not exceed one maund, or eighty-two pounds weight avoirdupois. Their rates of remuneration would make one of the \"fellowships\" in London stare, being about one anna, or three-halfpence, per mile ; for short distances, half that sum. For the conveyance of heavy goods, hackries, or bullock carts are available. The rate of hire, for short trips within the town, is about four annas, or sixpence ; for longer ones, from six to eight annas. These vehicles do not usually carry above half a ton, except of commercial produce, when they are limited to fifteen hundred-weight, the utmost they can safely bear."], [210, "186 BAZAARS, POLICE, ETC. Bazaars. \u2014 There are two markets in Calcutta for the supply of butchers' meat, poultry, fish, vegetables, and fruits, chiefly for the consumption of Europeans and other Chris tians. The oldest is Tiretta's Bazaar (now the property of the Rajah of Burdwan), situated on the east side of Chit pore-road, near the northern extremity of that part of the city occupied by Christians, and, consequently, in an incon venient situation. It is kept in bad condition, and very dirty ; so that few respectable persons ever visit it, servants being deputed to make purchases ; indeed, few people in Calcutta at 1 1 nd personally to such matters. The other bazaar is situated at the south-west corner of DhurrunitoUah-street, the northern extremity of the Chowringhee-road, an eligible site for the purpose. This bazaar has of late years been remodelled and enlarged at considerable expense. The stalls for meat, fish, and vegetables are weU built, with square brick pillars, supporting lofty and substantial raftered and tsied roofs, the whole well drained and kept clean ; the pathways with which it is intersected being some what convex, they are dry, so that people traverse this market with a degree of comfort not met with in other C_l cutta bazaars ; and, consequently, many respectable persons are seen there every morning. There are a great number of other bazaars in different parts of the city, for edibles for the native population, and the streets abound with petty shops of a similar nature, to the great disfigurement of many of the otherwise best parts of the city. Municipal Government \u2014 Police. \u2014 It has already been stated, that there are four magistrates and a superintendent of police, to detect, investigate, and punish, such ciinies as he within their competency. Offences beyond their cogni zance are sent up to the Supreme Court. For the suburbs there is a separate magistracy, whose power corresponds with that of the city officers. The posse comitatus, under the orders of these gentlemen, consists of a few European con stables and some hundreds of native police, whose duties correspond with those of pohce officers in other parts of the world ; but these duties are discharged in a manner peculiar to India. Serious crimes are fortunately not rife in Calcutta ; about two thousand cases per annum are heard by the"], [211, "187 A river voyage. magistracy, and these are chiefly larcenies, burglaries, and petty assaults. To the chief magistrate, some native gentle men, and the members of the Military Board, the conservancy of the town is intrusted ; and this conservancy duty com prises the charge of everything which relates to the clean liness and health of the population, the watering and lighting of the town. The funds whence the means of the conser vancy department are derived consist of the assessment on houses, the hquor sicenses, <fcc. It is a mistake, therefore, to pretend that the inhabitants are exempt from taxation, for no one can occupy a house without feeling, in the rent he pays, that his landlord is a large contributor to the coffers of the state. A VOYAGE FROM CALCUTTA TO ALLAHABAD. The hints offered in the section headed \" River Travel ling\" having been taken, the traveller sets forth in a budge row, or steamer, as the case may be. A curious and interesting scene is that which the right bank of the Hooghly, between Calcutta and Cossipore, pre sents to the river traveller. It is well worth the passage against the tide, to mark the strange dioramic sights which are to be seen, instinct with life and motion, and telling a history of past Indian grandeur, as well as of present desola tion. Embarking at Bankshall or Prinsep's ghaut, you are instantly among the shipping, which crowds the river before Calcutta. Passing beneath the tall sides of the unladen vessels, the boat threads its way, now coming alongside of a British craft, now passing under the stern of an American, and now of an Arab trader ; whilst the curious eye will observe the various crews at work on board \u2014 the clean and healthy-looking British seamen, the uncouth-looking lascars, and here and there, sitting at the stern-windows of some empty vessel from Bombay, a httle group of Parsees, high turbaned and white-vested. But the lofty masts of the shipping are soon left behind, and the boat passes the wide-ranging buildings of the Mint,"], [212, "188 THE FUNERAL PYRES. with their tall chimneys, \"grand against the sky.\" St. ering through a forest of shapeless pariah brigs, and large unwieldj salt-boats, we soon come to a spot suggestive of more painful thoughts, for there are the ghauts, where the dying are left to die \u2014 the Puttarah Ghaut, the Jora Bagan Ghaut \u2014 where the last ceremonies of the Gunga are performed, and then the Shussan, or place of cremation, where the bodies of tho dead are burnt. A strange, wild scene is this ! Standing back at some distance from the river is a high blackened wall, with flanks of masonry at either end, abutting upon the bank, which slopes, in a gentle descent, towards the river. In the centre of this wide black wall is an aperture, with a screen of masonry on the hither side, which shuts out the revolting scene from the road on the other side of the wall ; and at each angle of the curtain which we have described, is built up a shapeless hut of mats, to receive the poorer class of dying Hindoos, who cannot afford to pay the tax of the neighbouring ghauts. But turn you from the building, which is in itself, indeed, scarcely more than a great screen, erected to shut out the hideous scene of cremation from the road which passes it to the bank which slopes towards the river, black with the burnt ashes of the dead. Two or three fires are burning there, sending forth a dim red flame, whilst the spiral smoke ascends slowly, and one or two almost naked men crouch over the scanty pyres. There, too, are the char poys, or rude native beds, on which the corpses have been brought forth ; and hovering above are countless vultures, eager to glut themselves on the half-burnt corpses. Scores of these insatiate birds of prey are perched upon the abutting walls of the death-screen, waiting their opportunity to descend, whilst others, temporarily repulsed by the guardians of the funeral fires, fly heavily across the river, passing across tbe native boats, through the tattered sails of which you might mark their flight. Others again are feasting, a httle way apart from the human death-place, upon the carcase of an animal there exposed, and contending eagerly with the huge adjutant-birds and ravenous pariah-dogs. Altogether, it is a sickening sight, rendered infinitely more sickening by the abominable effluvia which issue from the bank of death."], [213, "189 LEFT BANK OF THE HOOGHLY. But these are soon passed. The bank again is densely lined with native boats, their rude sterns arranged in thick serried lines, and their strange oar-rudders far-projecting. These, you may see, are the homes of hundreds of human beings, who spend their lives there ; in each boat some ten or more strong men may be seen lying lazily about, cooking or eating their dinners, whilst on the banks which these shapeless vessels skirt, are numberless natives, men and women, the inhabitants of the far-spreading suburbs of Calcutta. Motley and inconsistent rows of dwelling-houses stretch along the river-bank, cottage and palace strangely commingled. Here a small group of miserable mat huts, there a stately but somewhat dilapidated edifice, with lofty pillars and wide colonnades \u2014 remains of a former state of grandeur \u2014 towering above a sine of salt-golahs, shapeless, matted structures, erected on scarp-walls of masonry, which form, in some places, the embankment of the river. Then you see a crowded ghaut, perhaps of recent erection, or, far more probably, one fallen into decay, the lower steps of which have sunk into the bed of the river, whilst numberless chasms, as though made by an earthquake, are discernible in the upper nights. Here, again, is a large rambsing house, overhanging the stream, with a long verandah above, and beneath an arched passage, through which the inhabitants of these strange abodes communicate with the river ; and there a Mahommedan mosque, with its domed cupolas, rising in a picturesque manner above a group of more humble edifices. Among these variform buildings, strangely interspersed, are here and there huge masses of heavy foliage, thick-leaved trees overhanging the water, with, in some places, their bare roots exposed to view, projecting beyond the bank. Every where the margin of the water is studded with human beings, some coming down to the river to bathe, others to fiU their vessels with water, whilst many boys and men are sitting on the banks, fishing with the rude tackle of the country. It is altogether a strange and interesting scene. Eastward of the left bank, and distant four miles from it, is Dum Dum, the large station for artillery. It is a spacious cantonment, with an extensive maida/wn, or esplanade, for purposes of parade, artillery practice, and review. 2,000"], [214, "190 DUM DUM AND BAIUIACKPOUE. men can here be accommodated. There is an arsenal and laboratory, where the gunners are taught their duty, and where the ammunition, stores, implements, (fee., requir. the service, are prepared. The church is an elegant building, and contains the monuments of some officers who have distinguished themselves. The mess-house, to which is attached a spacious sibrary and ball-room, is the finest build ing of the kind in India. The officers frequently entertain their Calcutta and Barrackpore friends here in unexampled good style. All artillery cadets, on their arrival in Bengal, proceed to Dum Dum, and undergo a certain amount of drill before they are detached to the Mofussil. At a distance of about twenty miles from Calcutta, after passing Cossipore, its villas, foundries, and factories, the village of Ishera, where there is a sugar and rum manu factory, the Orphan Refuge and its pretty church, Tittaghur and its sylvan dwellings, we reach the park of Barrackpore on the right, and the town of Serampore on the left. Barrackpore, called by the natives Achauuck (corrupted from C/tarrwck, the founder of Calcutta, who abided here), consists of a large park and a military cantonment, in the former of which is the spacious country-house of the Gover nor-General, while the latter affords accommodation to six regiments of native infantry, and the full proportion of officers. There is nothing remarkable about the Govern ment-House ; it is a plain edifice of one story in height, with lofty rooms and very ordinary furniture. Its acces sories are the best features it can boast of : an aviary and a menagerie, though neither arel very thickly tenanted ; a garden and a pleasant promenade, where the society of the station assemble, while one of the regimental bands plays upon the green sward, constitute the chief agremens of the place. Lord Auckland established a native school at Bar rackpore, and left funds for its support. The regiments here, with the artillery at Dum Dum (seven miles from Calcutta), and the troops in Fort Wilham, constitute the presidency division of the army, which is commanded by a general officer, who resides at Barrackpore. A brigadier imme diately under him commands the station. The position of the troops is convenient for immediate service to the east-"], [215, "THE RIGHT BANK. 191 ward of Bengal, and for the performance of military duties at Calcutta, where a large guard mounts, and is relieved once a month. There is a race-ground at Barrackpore, but races have not taken place there for some years. The sports of the place are confined to an occasional steeple-chase, a run with the Calcutta hounds, and a few balls and public dinners. Serampore. \u2014 This little settlement belonged until the last few years to the crown of Denmark. A governor, with a secretary, a judge, a magistrate, and a smasi detachment of troops, formed the administrative and protective force of the place, which is now only remarkable as the residence of a body of missionaries, the site of the printing establishment of the best newspaper in India, and of an excellent paper- manufactory, conducted by Mr. John Marshman. The col- lege founded here by the celebrated missionary Carey, has fallen to decay, though it still presents, as seen from the river, remains of architectural beauty. Many old gentlemen, pensioners of the East-India Company's government, reside at Serampore, as do several widows and poor families, from motives of economy. After passing Serampore, the banks of the river again present the varied scene described above, dotted here and there with small towns and factories, now in a partial state of decay. Among the towns, in the following order, are \u2014 Chan dernagore. \u2014 A small French settlement, with a governor, staff, and a judicial administration. Chinsurah. \u2014 Formerly one of the Dutch settlements, and now a barrack for a single European regiment. In the immediate neighbourhood is the village of Hooghly, the station of a collector and magistrate. Here, too, is a cosiege, containing, with its subordinate institutions, 1,500 students, nearly 1,200 of whom are Hindoos, and all learning English. In the vicinity of Chinsurah is the civil station of Hooghly, where persons proceeding up the countiy by dawk usually commence theh trip. The country between Hooghly and Burdwan is level and extensively cultivated ; the roads are good ; the small rivers are crossed at Satgaon and Muggra ghauts by suspension-bridges ; and there are bungalows at convenient intervals, and bazaars, where supphes are plen tiful. Burdwan is another civil station, where abide a"], [216, "192 BURDWAN TO BENARES. revenue collector, a judge, and magistrate, with their assist ants ; a surgeon, two or three indigo-planters, and a couple of missionaries. The town and surrounding zemindaree (or estate) were formerly governed by a rajah ; but the title only of the sovereignty has descended to his heirs, who for some years past have lived under the British Government aa simple landholders. At Burdwan are extensive collieries. Coal abounds in the plains that border the Damuda, but, owing to the want of good rail or tram roads, the price which it bears in the Calcutta market does not enable it to compete with Enghsh coal. The latter, including carriage, costs nine annas a maund \u2014 the Burdwan coal six annas \u2014 of which five annas are consumed in the expense of carriage ; and as one ton of English coal is equal to two tons of Burdwan coal, it follows that the Engsish is three annas a maund cheaper than the Burdwan. The establishment of the rail will go far to remedy this. From Burdwan to Benares, soon after entering the Ban coorah * district (Bograh), the road runs for upwards of 200 miles through a jungle, skirted by a chain of hills of no great altitude, which constitute the country and the fastnesses of the Coles. Scarcely a building, beyond the occasional bun galow, is to be seen. The places whence the stages take their name are, for the most part, either invisible villages, solitary chowkies (post-houses), or little temples. The bear ers stand out upon the road or at its edge, awaiting the arrival of the palankeen at the appointed hour, and receive it upon their shoulders from the others, whom they resieve without depositing it upon the ground, unless desired to do so by the party within. Bandel. \u2014 Once a Portuguese settlement, and still famous for a Roman Catholic church. Berhampore and Moorshedabad. \u2014 In its outward as pect, there is no European station which can bear any com parison with Berhampore : it is situated on the left bank of * West of Burdwan, at a distance of thirty miles, is Bancoorah, a small military station. It is exactly 102 miles from Calcutta ; and continuing the same road, parallel with the present route to Benares, we reach, at a distance of 240 miles, the salubrious hill-station of Huzareebagh, which has barracks for an European regiment."], [217, "berhampore. 193 the Hooghly, and is arrayed with the utmost splendour of foliage ; the flowering trees attaining a gigantic size, and the more common offspring of the forest occurring in great pro fusion, and seeming to riot in rich luxuriance. The cantonments of Berhampore are well laid out and handsomely built ; the quarters of the officers being of brick, covered with cement, like the puckah palaces of Calcutta, and forming uniform ranges of considerable extent. The grand square, a spacious quadrangle, incloses an excellent parade-ground ; and stately houses, belonging to civilians and other permanent residents, arise in convenient spots in the neighbourhood, giving to the whole station an air of im portance not usuasiy found in garrisons, where the pompous array of fortresses and bristhng bulwarks is wanting. To contrast with asi this beauty, and to show the deceitfulness of outward appearances, a large arena, filled with monu mental stones, gives mournful evidence of the unhealthiness of the atmosphere, and of the grim dominion of death in the midst of the most lavish productions of nature. Berham pore hes low, and had not been sufficiently drained before its occupation by European troops. There is a manufactory of silk at Berhampore, which fur nishes the bandana handkerchiefs so much prized in England, together with taffetas and washing silks. Beautiful pieces of workmanship of various kinds in carved ivory are also brought for sale from the neighbouring city of Moorshedabad. Though the artisans of the native capital of the province of Bengal cannot support any comparison with the delicate per formances of the Chinese, they exhibit considerable sksil in the delineations of men and animals. The common kinds of chessmen, boards furnished with richly-cut pegs for the game of solitaire, paper-presses, and wafer-seals, are exceedingly well executed, and cheap, compared with the European prices for similar articles. The amusements of Berhampore are considerably increased by its proximity to Moorshedabad, a city which was once the capital of Bengal, and which is still the residence of the pensioned descendant of its former rulers. The princes of the present day are content to support an outward show of magnificence upon an income of sixteen lacs (160,000?.) a year, asiowed them by the East-India Company. The city o"], [218, "194 RAJMUHAL AND MALDA. of Moorshedabad is well situated, and forms I pleasing object from the river, but contains nothing worthy of nol the modern palace of the Nawab, which is a splendid in the European style, trf dazzling whiteness, and rising in glittering splendour amid stately groves of flowering trees. There is abundance of sport in the neighbourhood of Ber hampore. TheRajmuhal hills upon the opposite side swarm with larger game, and the low lands around are alive with partridge, wild fowl, and hares, according to the s< : The scenery now resumes the aspect which it wore at the earlier part of the trip \u2014 ghauts, temples, villages, alternately decorate the banks.

But enter the village as an artist, and how massive, rich, and varied is the foliage ! What exquisite foregP for Ruysdael or Hobbima ! What splendid sights and solemn murky shades for Rembrandt ! What brutal, filthy clowns for Teniers ! And what villanous, hairy faqueers, rugged stumps, mouldering ruins, and shocking old women, for Sal vator ! Large masses of the palace are now lying in the river. The Hindoo has not here left a vestige of his politi cal power. The Mussulman is to be traced by his noble ruins.\" A little to the eastward of Rajmuhal is Malda, a civil station, where also reside a few planters. A few miles to the south of Malda, the antiquary will find matter of interest in the ruins of Gour, once the capital of Bengal. Its decline and abandonment wrere caused by the desertion of the Ganges which formerly flowed beside its wasis. About 200 years"], [219, "195 GOUR. ago, the course of the river took a new direction, turning off to a considerable distance from the place to which it had brought wealth and sanctity. To no part of the city, occupying a space of twenty square miles, does the Ganges now approach nearer than four miles and a half, and places formerly navigable are now twelve miles from the stream, which so unaccountably and capriciously forsook its ancient bed. The wild luxuriance of vegetation which characterizes Bengal has nearly choked up the magnificent remains of Gour ; and the splendour of the city can only be estimated by a few majestic remains of mosques, towers, and gateways, which still exist to show how deeply it was indebted to architectural taste and skill. The buildings of Gour were very sohdly constructed of brick and stone. Vast quantities of the materials have been carried away and sold for build ing in the neighbouring towns and villages ; but there are still masses of strong masonry scattered over the surface of the ground, which have been so completely covered with brushwood, and so intermixed with the gigantic roots of trees, forcing themselves through the rifts made by time and the elements, as more to resemble huge mounds of earth than the remains of human habitations. Sikrigullee. \u2014 Eighteen miles above Rajmuhal we come to SikriguUee, a village at the base of a high rocky eminence, commanding a fine view of two ranges of hills. There is at this place the tomb of a celebrated Mahomedan saint, Peer Pointie, and a cave in a limestone rock, both of which are worthy inspection. Higher up is a place called Peer Pointie, now a mass of ruins, where another tomb of the saint is found. Colgong. \u2014 Three picturesque rocks covered with verdure. A few Hindoo devotees reside upon them, in wretched huts, surrounded by, and almost embedded in, vegetation as noxious as it is picturesque. Bhaugulpore. \u2014 The Ganges is here of great breadth. In the rainy season, when the waters have risen, the river is not less than eight miles across ! The situation of Bhaugul pore is pretty and healthy. It commands a distant view of Mount Mandar, an insulated conical hill, renowned as a place of Hindoo pilgrimage. There are some silk manufactories here, which produce a coarse stuff\", called baftah, and a o 2"], [220, "196 JUNGHEERA. sighter silk, termed tusser, much used, when stretched upofl a\"frame, for room-punkahs, aud also for gem \"louses and ladies' morning-dresses. The station is a civil one ; but a corps of hill rangers, composed of the Puharees, or hill men, is kept up in an excellent state of discipline, to protect tin oonntry from banditti, and otherwise to act as the magis trate may occasionally require. The Puharees, who in the neighbouring hills, are not many degrees removed from the savage race. They hve chiefly by the chase, and always go armed. They are hospitable and honest in their inter course with one another, though accustomed to make preda tory inroads upon their neighbours or hereditary foes. Their probity is remarkable, and they are faithful when employed as servants. They believe in a Supreme Being, to they offer up sacrifices, and have adopted the doctrine of metempsychosis. Jungheera. \u2014 Of the interesting places which lie between Rajmuhal and Monghyr, the most celebrated is the rock of Jungheera. It consists of several masses of grey granite, rising boldly from the river. It is supposed to have formerly been a point of land projecting from the shore, but it is now completely isolated by the violence of the current. Trees have imbedded their roots amid the crevices of this pictu resque rock, and on its ten-aces several smkll temples are erected. It has been, during many ages, considered one of the most sacred places on the Ganges, and is a great resort of Hindoo devotees, who crowd to it, not only on account of its reputed sanctity, but to offer their homage at the shrine of Narayan, an idol of great celebrity at this place, whose figure is preserved in one of the pagodas, and sculptured upon several parts of the rock, together with those of Vishnu, Suree, and Sirooj. Jungheera is inhabited by Hindoo fakeers, who are not above asking charity of the European voyagers on the river. Between the two rocks there is a ghaut, or landing-place, gently sloping into the water. From this ghaut the ascent to the summit is by flights of steps cut out of the solid rock. In the temple which crowns this height, the principal fakeer is usually to be seen sitting on a tiger-skin, by way of carpet, and having the skull of one of these animals by his side. Monghyr, when our possessions were more limited than"], [221, "197 MONGHYR. they now are, formed one of the principal military stations of the British army. When it was selected for the depot for ammunition, it enjoyed all the honours of a frontier fortress ; but, in consequence of the immense portion of territory which now divides it from the boundaries of our possessions, it has been suffered to fall into decay. A few invalided soldiers garrison the dismantled citadel, and several invalid officers have selected it as a residence, on account of its cheapness and salubrity. Monghyr is situated upon a rocky promontory abutting into the Ganges ; and the walls of the fort, raised upon a sharp angle, have a fine effect, although they are rapidly wearing away. The Ganges at this place is extremely wide, and vessels being often detained by contrary winds at the ghauts of Monghyr, when a change takes place, the whole surface of the water is covered with barks of every descrip tion. The remains of the fort are very striking ; the plain is diversified by ridges of rock richly wooded ; and upon some of the most favourable sites, the European residents have erected those palace-hke houses, which give a regal air to the splendid landscapes of Bengal ; some of the residences are painted a bright orange relieved with white. The native town is irregular, and in many parts extremely picturesque, several of the bazaars stretching in long lines beneath the umbrageous shelter of magnificent groves. The place of worship in most repute amongst the Mahomedans is the monument of Peer Shah Lohouni, which is held in great reverence by all classes of the people ; the Hindoos making frequent offerings at the shrine of this saint, so highly is his memory venerated throughout the district. A considerable trade is carried on at Monghyr from the manufactories of the place ; the workmen possess consider able skisi, and construct palankeens, European carriages, and furniture, in a very creditable manner. Under the inspec tion of persons well acquainted with these arts, they can produce goods of a very good description, and at an astonish ingly low price. The most famous of its manufactories is that of the blacksmith, who works up steel and iron into a great variety of forms ; these goods are coarse, but they are useful, especiasiy to the natives, and remarkably cheap. Double-barrelled guns are sold for thirty-two rupees each,"], [222, "198 MONGHYR. rifles at thirty, and table knives and forks at six rup. dozen. Upon the arrival of a budgerow at Monghyr, the native vendors of almost innumerable commodities repair to the water-side in crowds, establishing a sort of fair upon the spot. Cages filled with specimens of rare birds from the hills, or with the more interesting of the reptiles, small deer, Seetakoond spring water, chairs, tables, work-boxes, baskets, and cutlery of all kinds, are brought down to tempt the new arrivals. It is perhaps safest to confine the purehi iron goods of native construction ; spears, which are neces sary articles in the upper country, are of the best kind, and are sold at a rupee and a quarter each ; and the un, iron tripods in which charcoal is burned, are excellent. Tho guns and rifles constructed here are dangerous imphi from the worthlessness of the screws and brittleness of the barrels. Since the importation of European fashions, a vast number of new articles have been introduced into the shops of the natives ; tea-kettles, tea-trays, toasting-forks, sauce pans, and other culinary vessels, unknown in the kitchens of the Moslem or Hindoo, are exhibited for sale. The fort of Monghyr occupies a large portion of ground, and, though no longer affording any idea of a place of defence, is both striking and ornamental. It has not, like Allahabad, been ever modernized, or adapted to the prevail ing system of warfare, but retains all its Asiatic character. Within the walls there is a plain of considerable extent, sprinkled with some majestic trees, and having two large tanks of water. The European society at Monghyr is rather limited ; and in consequence of the major part being composed of persons belonging to the invalid establishment, who seek it as a place of retirement, the station is never a scene of gaiety ; there are, however, appointments which are held by civil and military servants of the Company, who form a little circle amongst themselves, which is enlivened, occasionally, by the visits of strangers passing up and down, and officers upon military duties, surveys, <kc, from Dinapore, which is situated at an easy distance. The attractions of Monghyr, as a l-esidence, are confined to the scenery, which combines every beauty that the rich and fertile provinces on either side can produce. About five miles from Monghyr, there are some"], [223, "MONGHYR. 199 hot springs, which few people fail to visit who touch at the town. They are situated at Seeta-coond, \" well of Seeta,\" and though not possessing any medicinal properties, the water is much sought after on account of its great purity. The springs are inclosed in a cistern of brick, eighteen feet square. The temperature is so hot (maximum, 163\u00b0), that the hand cannot be retained in it for many seconds. Large quantities of gas are continually disengaged from the basin. Rice, when thrown in, swesis, and floats on the surface. The wesi is sacred, and several Brahmins are estabhshed in its neighbourhood, who are not above receiving a few copper coins for regenerating the pilgrims, who resort hither to bathe in a neighbouring pool. The ground in the neighbourhood of these springs is exceedingly rocky, and furnishes many curious geological specimens ; fluor and mica are plentiful, and ubrue, talc, or lapis specularis, also is very common. It is found in large masses, which divide easily into tough, thin lamin\u00e6, perfectly transparent. Formerly this substance was in much request with Europeans as a substiute for window-glass, but it is not now ever used for that purpose. It still forms the decora tions at native festivals ; and when painted with a variety of colours, and illuminated, it is often employed in the con struction of mimic palaces, rivalling that of Aladdin in splendour. The hisis in the distance are chiefly composed of limestone, far advanced in decomposition ; they are exceed ingly wild in their appearance, and inhabited by numerous tribes of savage animals. Agriculture, as well as manufactures, flourishes in the neighbourhood of Monghyr ; grain of all kinds, sugar, and indigo, are in great abundance, and the country is celebrated for its opium. Immense fields of poppies, which, though they have been not unjustly described as all glare and stalk, have a gay appearance \u2014 their flowers varying in colours, hke the tulip or the anemone, and changing with every breeze that sweeps across them \u2014 render part of the cultivated dis trict one wide parterre. Cotton plantations abound ; the paths are strewed with pods full to bursting, which disclose the soft treasure within, appearing like a lump of wool inter mixed with a few black seeds. There are also large tracts of indigo. Cocos are not supposed to grow luxuriantly except"], [224, "200 PATNA, in the vicinity of the coast; but their cultivation in many inl_j___ situations iu India shows that a little care alone is necessary for their introduction into the most rem Hindostan. The natives of Monghyr are a quiet, industrious race, 1 -arely participating in the crimes which are so frequently perpetrated iii the upper and lower country. Lil s, however, they are exceedingly litigious, and the attention of the public courts is taken up by suits of the most frivolous nature. Above Monghyr, on the opposite bank of the Ganges, is a bond (in its average dimensions forty -five feet wide at the base, ten in width at the top, and nine feet in height), forming an elevated road, on which carriages of any description may safely be driven. It was constructed to check the incursions of the river, which threatened to inundate the province. Another cross bund, supplied with sixteen sluices for the pur pose of irrigation, is constructed iu the same neighbourhood. From Monghyr to Patna there is little of any interest upon the banks, in the shape of picturesque scenery or busy town. The places successively passed are Rassalpore, Soorajgurra, Deeriapore, Bar, Phoolbarrea, and Futwa. Much grain grows upon and in the vicinity of the banks, but the major part of the country is meadow land, inter spersed with villages and trees. Fruit-trees are cultivated in the gardens of the village, especially the mango, the wal nut, and the tarea palm. Numerous oxen (buffaloes) and cows \u2014 so sacred in the estimation of the Hindoo \u2014 are seen grazing near the river ; and the lanky black pig of the country likewise contributes his presence to ensiven the scene. At Bar there are a good many boats, and the appear ance of an active trade. Beggars also swarm there, and are troublesomely importunate in their demands for alms. Futwa, a httle beyond which the Pompon falls into the Ganges, is celebrated for the good quahty and cheapness of the table linen manufactured there. About ten miles higher up we come upon the suburbs of Patna, where remains of old walls, towers, and bastions, attest the original importance of this celebrated town. Patna is the first native city of wealth and importance on"], [225, "201 PATNA AND DINAP0RE. the Ganges. It stands on the right bank of the river, and here the marshy sosi of Bengal is exchanged for the arid sands of Hindostan : camels seldom penetrate farther, and from this point the hot winds cease to be felt. Patna, though it does not contain any single building of great celebrity or pecusiar beauty, is rich in the remains of Mussulman splendour, and its appearance from the river is highly picturesque. The houses of the wealthy classes are handsome buildings, flat-roofed, and surrounded by carved balustrades. The intermixture of these residences with per fect, broad ghauts, the remains of Gothic gateways of dark red stone, and the numerous temples devoted to Hindoo and Mussulman worship, produces a striking effect. Upon the first subjection of the upper country to the Company, the city of Patna became the residence of the civilians employed by the government ; but they have now established themselves at Bankipore, a convenient spot by the river side, a short distance beyond the suburbs. The houses of the civil servants who belong to the Behar district are built in the style of those of Calcutta, and are chiefly puckah ; many are very stately edifices, having broad terraces overlooking the Ganges, and being surrounded with luxuriant plantations. The situation of Patna possesses many advantages. Being placed on the border of Bengal, it commands an easy com munication with the upper and lower provinces ; supplies are rapidly procured from Calcutta by the river, and the earliest choice of articles may be obtained from the cargoes. The military cantonments of Dinapore are only a few miles distant, and at favourable periods contribute not a little to the gaiety of the district. The cantonments are handsome and well laid out ; and the performances of the misitary bands in the evening, upon the parade-ground, attract the whole population to the spot. Dinapore has the advantage of its neighbour in the beauty of the surrounding country ; it is better wooded, and more picturesque ; but it may be said with truth of almost every part of Hindostan, that the face of the country bears two aspects, being exceedingly ugly in the dry season, and very beautiful in the rains."], [226, "202 PATNA. Patna is a stronghold of Mahomeilanism, and the disciples ofthe prophet who dwesi within its walls are far more fanatic and intolerant than their brethren of Bengal. The riches of the city enable it to celebrate the obsequies of the young martyrs, Hossein and Houssien, hi a very splendid manner ; and their noble square is selected for the final deposit the tazuhs, or tombs, which are carried about in commemora tion of the funeral honours paid by the followers of Ali to his slaughtered sons. Patna carries on an extensive trade, and is famous for its manufactories of table-linen, wax candles, lackered toys, aud talc pictures. It also possesses very expert workmen in every department of mechanical art. Amongst the minor branches are bird-cages, constructed with great ingenuity and even elegance, the frames of some being delicately inlaid with ivory, while the wires of others are strung with coloured beads. The natives of India are fond of keeping birds as domestic pets. The beautiful little avadawats, or lolls, as they are commonly called by the natives, on account o; bright ruby colour, are in great request ; these, together with many other kinds, are easily procurable at Patna. This city is a grand mart for opium.* The soil is also favourable to the growth of potatoes, a vegetable which is much cultivated for native consumption hi India. . The streets of Patna can only be traversed on horseback, or upon an elephant, being too narrow to admit of any wheel carriage superior to the native rhut, a creaking vehicle com posed of wood and rope, in which the ladies of the country, concealed from pubsic view by thick curtains, huddle them selves when they travel or pay visits ; and the ecka, a light pony-gig, on two wheels, covered with cloth. The best houses * The poppy is cultivated to a very considerable extent in the vicinity, and the opium thence extracted, is the property of the East-India Company. Including the opium manufactured in Malwa, the Com pany derives a revenue of scarcely less than 3,000,000?. sterling from the opium monopoly. This is nearly equal to one-seventh of the entire revenue of India ! This great source of income has the pecu liarity of being paid, not by our own subjects, but by strangers, con sisting of Chinese, Malays, and Javanese. The principal consumers of opium are the Chinese. The opium transmitted to Calcutta in chests is sold by auction, and shipped by merchants to the Chinese ports. As many as 50,000 chests of 140 Ibs. each are annually exported."], [227, "HADJEEPORE. 203 face the river ; many of these have a dismal appearance on the side of the street, showing only a high blank wall, per forated with a few smasi windows in the upper story. Other mansions are enclosed in large walled courts ; and in passing along the principal street, many porticoes are visible peeping out of recesses, or small quadrangles, which seem to be the entrances to buildings belonging to people of rank. The houses tenanted by the middling classes are exceedingly crazy, and have somewhat of a Chinese air, each story lessening in size, and standing in the verandah of the one below. They are removed a little from the public path, crowded during the day with men and animals, by being raised upon a plat form about a foot high from the street. The houses occupy the centre of this platform, a margin being left all round, which sometimes stretches beyond the verandah, and forms a shelf, or counter, on which the goods of the inferior shop keepers are displayed in baskets, none of the richer and more elegant articles being exposed to. public view in India. The shop of the hukeems, or apothecaries, make the best appear ance : they are furnished in the primitive style, with herbs of various kinds neatly arranged. Amidst much that is unsightly, there is a something to admire in the long avenue which stretches from gate to gate of the city, every few yards bringing some picturesque object to view ; lofty open cupolas, in the most elegant style of Mogul architecture, surmounting mosques, or contrasted with solid towers of the dark red stone, which seems to have been the favourite material in former times. One of these latter is a singular building, somewhat resembling a glass-house ; it was intended for a granary, but has never been used for that or any other public purpose, excepting as an occasional powder magazine. On the opposite bank of the river, at Hadjeepore, or in its neighbourhood, at Sonepore, a fair is held annually, which attracts a vast concourse of people, both native and Euro pean, to its festivities. The period is regulated by the changes of the moon. The natives come in thousands to bathe at the confluence of the Ganges and the Gunduck, which of course possesses a double virtue. Duty carries some of the civil servants to the scene of action, and others pro ceed thither in order to recreate themselves, during a brief"], [228, "204 HADJEEPORE FAIR. period, with the amusements whirl; from various parts of the country seldom G The fair takes place at a conveniein h no - ment of the cold weather.

Many of the tents are extremely splendid, those of the wealthy natives, in particular, being boi with scarlet cloth, cut into fanciful patters. The double poled tents of the civilians are scarcely, if at aU, inferior in their external decoration, and the interiors are furnished with great elegance. Rich carpets are spread over the selt ringees which cover the floor, and small chandeliers are sus pended from the roof. The walls are hung with some gay patterned chintz, and the sideboards glitter with plate. No privations are felt by the dwellers under canvas : the n being equally wesi served in the midst of a sandy wTaste as in the kitchen attached to a magnificent mansion. The Mahomedans, who consist of Syuds, Sheikhs, Moguls, and Patans, form a large part of the population of the city of Patna, which embraces about 300,000 souls.

There are many mosques or musjids in Patna, but the prii place of actual worship is the monument of Shah Arzani, about the middle of the western suburb. Adjacent to the tank is an Imaumbarah, where 100,000 people assemble, with the pageantry used hi celebrating the Mohurrum, in com memoration of the grandsons of the prophet. The only places of worship at all remarkable among the followers of the Brahmins, are the temples of the great and httle Patana devi, Pataneswari, or the guardian of Patana, i. e. the city."], [229, "205 CHUPRAH AND BUXAR. The building is small, but avowedly recent, and has been erected at the expense of the priests. Passing Dinapore and Deegah, once an extensive farm, but now a provisioner's store, where every variety of cured pork and beef may be had in great abundance and of good quality, we see the embouchure of the river Soane, or golden river, which rises in the distant mountainous country of Gundava. This river affords millions of beautiful pebbles and petrefactions, which are cut and sold for bracelets, &c. Above the mouth of this river are many Moslem and Hindoo ruins, but they are not visible unless the traveller lands. Chuprah. \u2014 This is a civil station, the capital of Sarun. The town, which consists of one large and several small streets, contains a great many native houses, and some mosques and pagodas. It extends for about a mile or more along the bank of the Ganges. The district of Sarun is one of the healthiest in India, but the roads are bad, and there is little or no game to reward the toil of the sportsman. The town of Chuprah contains 50,000 souls, which is about a twentieth part of the entire population of the district. To the east of Chuprah hes the district of Tirhoot, where immense quantities of indigo are grown. The civil station of Tirhoot is Mozufferpore. This district is separated from the kingdom of Nepaul by a jungly swamp, called the Terai, which affords excellent cover for game, but is so unhealthy as to be impassable at certain seasons. The climate of the province of Behar, which we have now entered, is, in some respects, superior to that of Bengal. The nights are generally much cooler ; but the province is more subject to great droughts and heat, and to parching winds from the west. Tirhoot, the north-western quarter of the province, is more elevated and healthier than the districts to the south. After passing Revelgunge, famous for the number of boats built there, and the villages of Boujpore and Bhulea, we reach Buxar, where the river runs rather narrow. Buxar. \u2014 This place, celebrated in the history of British India as the scene of the battle which confirmed us in possession of Bengal and Behar, is a large Mussulman town. A few invalid soldiers reside in the fort, but the circumstance"], [230, "206 GHAZEErORE. which chiefly imparts importance to the place, is the Com pany's stud which is kept up here and at Koruiitadhee, on the opposite side of the river. These studs produce the finest horses for cavalry and artillery purposes in India. The country round about is rich in grain, wheat, oats, and b Here the thatched houses of the natives begin to disappear, and the tiled roofs, common to the upper provinces, to make their appearance. Nothing further of interest presents itself on either bank beyond a ruined fort or two, and some indigo factories (where the river traveller always finds a welcome), until we get to Ghazeepore. \u2014 A military cantonment where one regiment is generally quartered, a civil station, another stud depot, and a celebrated place for the manufacture of rose water. The appearance of the town, as seen from the river, is rather pleasing than otherwise. The houses are chiefly bruit of a flesh-coloured stone, procurable at the neighbouring station of Chunar, which gives them an imposing exterior. The most remarkable edifices are the palace of Cossim Ah Kahn, a new fort, crumbling to decay, and the cenotaph to the memory of the Marquis of Cornwallis. This latter stands about 100 paces from the banks of the Ganges, in the rear of the barracks, and is built in imitation of the Sibyl's temple. At the end of a grove is a circular enclosure, fenced ly handsome hon railings eight feet high. In the centre of this is the tomb. On the face fronting the main entrance (or rather the only one, for the doorway farthest from the river opens only into the colonnade, there being no steps on that side for descending to the ground), between two natives. a Hindoo to the right and a Mahomedan to the left \u2014 in attitudes of lamentation, is a large medallion charged with a profile of Lord Cornwallis in bas rehef.

He framed a system of judicature Which restrained within strict bounds the powers of public functionaries, And extended to the population of India the effective protection of laws Adapted to their usages, and promulgated in their own languages. Invited, in December, 1804, to resume the same important station, He did not hesitate, though in advanced age, to obey the call of his country. During the short term of his last administration, He was occupied in forming a plan for the pacification of India, Which, having the sanction of his high authority, was carried into effect By his successor. He died near this spot, where his remains are deposited, On the 5th day of October, 1805, in the 67th year of his age. This monument, erected by the British Inhabitants of Calcutta, Attests their sense of those virtues, Which will live in the remembrance of grateful millions, Long after it shall have mouldered in the dust. The reverse side of the monument is occupied by a shield emblazoned with the Company's arms, on one side of which is a British grenadier, and on the other a native sepoy, both resting on their arms reversed. Below, is a long inscription in the Persian character, and on each side of the monument is a large wreath of laurel. The palace of Cossim Ali Kahn will, on inspection, repay the admirer of Saracenic architecture for the time he may bestow upon it. The English church is also a fine building, and the school and the jail are worth a brief visit. The celebrity of Ghazeepore for its rose-water justifies our giving some minute particulars of its manufacture, from a popular authoress who has spoken of it at large. \" The precious incense of the rose, the atta-gool, so cele- brated throughout all the civilized parts of the world, is produced in considerable quantities in the gardens round"], [232, "208 ROSE-WATER factory. Ghazeepore. The Indian rose, though its very name to imply distinction, can only sustain a comparison with its European sisters in the fragrance which it yields. It is beautiful, but excepting at Agra, it does not attain to the magnificent size common in England, nor does it present the infinite varieties which adorn our gardens. The culti of India are content to take what the hand of nature has given them, and resort to few aids for the improvement of her lavish beauties ; to a large majority, the be too valuable a plant to be made the mere embellishment of a bouquet, and for commercial purposes, that which they have found indigenous to the soil proves quite sufficient.* * * The roses of Ghazeepore are planted formally in large fields, occupying many hundred acres of the adjacent country. \" The first process wluch they undergo when convertible into a fragrant liquid is that of distillation. They are put into the alembic with nearly double their weight of water. The gooldabee pddnee (rose-water) thus obtained is poured into large shallow vessels, which are exposed uncovered to the open ah during the night. The navnen, or jars, are skim med occasionally ; the essential oil floating on the surface, being the precious concentration of aroma so highly prized by the worshippers of the rose. It takes 200,000 flowers to produce the weight of a rupee in atta. This small quantity, when pure and unadulterated with sandal-oil, sells upon the spot at 100 rupees (ten pounds), an enormous price, which, it is said, does not yield very large profits. A civilian having made the experiment, found that the rent of land producing the above-named quantity of atta, and the purchase of the utensils, alone, came to five pounds ; to this sum the hire of labourers remained still to be added, to say nothing of the risk of an unproductive season. The Damascus, or rose of Sharon, is the flower in most esteem in some parts of India; in others, the common cabbage or hundred-leaved rose is the favourite. The oil produced by the above-mentioned pi is not always of the same colour, being sometimes green, sometimes bright amber, and frequently of a reddish hue. When skimmed, the produce is carefully bottled, each vessel being hermetically sealed with wax, and the bottles are then exposed to the strongest heat of the sun during several days. \" Rose-water which has been skimmed is reckoned inferior"], [233, "209 GHAZEEPORE ENVIRONS. to that which retains its essential oil, and is sold at Ghazee pore at a lower price ; though, according to the opinion of many persons, there is scarcely, if any, perceptible difference in the quality. A seer (a full quart) of the best may be obtained for eight annas (about one shilsing). Rose-water enters into almost every part of the domestic economy of the natives of India ; it is used for ablutions in medicine, and in cookery. Before the abolition of nuzzurs (presents), it made a part of the offering of persons who were not rich enough to load the trays with gifts of greater value. It is poured over the hands after meals ; and at the festival of the Hoolee, all the guests are profusely sprinkled with it. Europeans, suffering under attacks of prickly heat, find tbe use of rose-water a great alleviation. Natives like it in ternally for all sorts of complaints ; they consider it to be the sovereignest thing on earth for an inward bruise, and eau de Cologne cannot be more popular in France than the goolaabee paame in India Rose-water, also, when bottled, is exposed to the sun for a fortnight at least. The environs of Ghazeepore are planted with fine forest trees. Birds abound, the branches are loaded with the pen dulous nests of the crested sparrow, and the blue jay sports in dangerous proximity to the Ganges, being selected at a barbarous Hindoo festival as a victim to the cruel Doorga. There are some fine old banian-trees in the neighbourhood of Ghazeepore ; one in particular, which overshadows a ghaut in an adjacent visiage, may be styled the monarch of the Ganges. This tree, as well as the peepul, is sacred ; and when a Brahmin takes up his abode under its boughs, it becomes an asylum for all sorts of animals ; the fine old patriarch of the woods near Ghazeepore is the haunt of innumerable monkeys, which actually crowd the branches, and gambol along the steps of the ghaut, perch upon its balustrades, and play their antics with the bathers in perfect security, and in multitudes which remind the gazer of rabbits in a warren. Snakes are very numerous in this part of the country, and their deadly enemy, the mungoose, is frequently seen on the watch for his victims, which he pursues with unrelenting animosity. Village and cultivated field, temple and factory, ghauts p"], [234, "210 BENARES. and stately trees, now greet the eye until the boat approaches the holy city of Benares (399 miles from Calcutta by land). \u2014 Hindoo superstition has its chosen abode. Rank intoli to this moment characterises the bearing of its inhabitants towards people of all persuasions.* In external appearance, Benares is a miniature Naples, being built upon a curve washed by the Ganges, which thus resembles a little bay. The city rises from the river ; spires, temples, ghauts, with long flights of steps, balconies, lofty houses, intermixed with trees, walls, minarets, <fec, all in close contiguity, giving it the air of a populous and densely-built town. The aspect within verifies the view from without. The streets are so narrow, that wheeled carriages cannot pass ; an el will occupy the entire width, and make sad havoc with the wares placed a foot or two from the shop fronts. Tin remarkable building is an observatory, originally erected for the use of the Hindoo astronomer, but now completely di. used. The view from its summit is most striking. Oriental learning flourishes at Benares, and its wealth, considerable from the operations of commerce, is much enhanced by the frequent visits of pilgrims of the highest rank, who not only make propitiatory offerings, but spend considerable sums in their own pleasures. The trade of the town consists chiefly in shawls, precious stones, gold and silver brocades, called \"/ibs, gold and silver tissue, lace, and fringes. There is a military cantonment bere, at Secrole, four miles distant, where three infantry regiments and a proportion of artillery are quartered. At Secrole there is a church, pretty theatre, and a racket-ground. The bungalows of the European officers are commodious buildings, and as the society of the station consists of some forty or fifty individuals, life glides away pleasantly enough, especially if the general officer who commands the division and the judge of the district are * Benares is one of the most unsafe and rebellious cities in Hin dostan. It once successfully opposed a house-fax imposed on the peopl* by the British Government.

The population of the district consists of nearly 520,000 souls, 174,000 of whom reside in the city. The Hindoo population may be divided into the sour great divisions of the Hindoo Shasters. The present rajahs of Benares claim to be \" Bhoomijas Brahmins,\" or Brahmins cultivating the soil. They represent themselves to be of the higher castes of pure descent. Among the higher classes of the Hindoos, the strictest appearance of morality is maintained ; and infidelity involves the penalty of loss of caste, ruin, and disgrace to the female \u2014 the husband being, likewise, an outcast, till he has per formed certain resigious atonements, and purchased restora tion to his caste by feeding his brethren, or Brahmins. The lower classes wear the marriage tie sightly ; but they are faithful, for the time, to the persons with whom they may be united, whether he be a husband or protector. Among these, the Domes, Passees, and Bhurs, are apparently the aboriginal possessors of the country ; but they now perform the lowest offices, being burners of the dead, watchmen, and scavengers. They are regarded as most impure by the higher classes of the Hindoos, and to touch or approach them is defilement. They are much given to theft and pilfering. The Pagans may be considered as amounting to 457,417, and the Mahomedans to 62,486. In Benares and its vicinity there may be from 200 to 300 Christians, and the missionaries have many schools and chapels throughout the city. The Hindoo temples are extremely wealthy in endowments, and are in good repair, while the Mahomedan mosques are in many instances ruinous and deserted. This town has been described by the late Colonel Davidson as the \" Jerusalem of Hindostan.\" \" It,\" he says, \" swarms with orthodox and heretodox teachers of the worship of all the gods. It also swarms with Brahminee bulls ; devout, rich, corpulent, active, and anchylosed mendicants.

Mirzapore (401 miles from Calcutta), a trading town of considerable consequence, is next reached. It is large and populous, not unlike Benares in its general aspect as well as in its position upon the river. The Mirzapore carpets are famous all over India ; but the importance of the town is chiefly derived from its position as the emporium of all the cotton grown in the interior. Many hundred boats are employed to convey this staple, in its raw condition, to Cal cutta, whence it is shipped to Europe and China, or \u25a0*\u25a0 up for consumption in the country. There is an establish ment of civil officers here, and a regiment occupies the can tonment. The river now winds considerably ; the high lands, c the Bingie Hills, hitherto in view, are entirely lost sight of, and the banks become uninteresting as far up as the Dooab, where the junction of the waters of the rivers Jumna and Ganges takes place, and at the extremity of which stands Allahabad.

Thi itself does not display those remains of magnificence which might have been expected in a place once favoured by the presence of royalty. It now retains few vestiges of the Mogul conquest, save the appellation and the buildings before mentioned, its Mussulman inhabitants being limited in num bers, and of little importance as regards their wealth, rank, or talent. The city is almost wholly given up to idolatry, and has ever been celebrated for the pilgrimage of pious"], [237, "ALLAHABAD. 213 Hindoos, attracted to a spot blessed by the junction of two sacred rivers. The principal object of curiosity and attraction at Allaha bad is the fort, which is erected upon the point of land stretching into the waters of the Ganges and Jumna, whose broad currents are united beneath its walls. Though in jured in its appearance by the alterations and additions necessary to transform an ancient Mogul castle into a place of strength, according to the modern art of fortification, it still retains somewhat of its Oriental and feudal air, rising in majestic grandeur from the river, whence it may be espied at a very considerable distance. There are low posterns leading to the glacis facing the river ; but the principal entrance of the Fort of Allahabad is landward, and is not to be paralleled in magnificence by any building intended for a similar purpose. A noble arched hall, in the Gothic style, surmounted by a dome, aud enriched with \" arabesques of gold and flowers,\" appears beyond the ample portal, an entrance worthy of the finest citadel in the world. The interior, containing ranges of buildings not entirely divested of the beauty of their original architec ture, affords, at least during two seasons of the year, some of the most delightful residences to be found in India. A suite of apartments, intended for the use of the Governor, but which is sometimes occupied by an inferior officer, commands a splendid view of the Jumna, with its craggy heights and wild sandy shores. From a balcony perched near the summit of a tower on which the windows of one of the chambers open, a prospect of singular beauty is obtained.

A toler ably well-supported book-club furnishes the floating literature ofthe day, to tbe many who seek for amusement ouly in tin pages of a book. The rocky character of the bed of the Jumna affords to geologists a field for their pursuits, which they would seek in vain in the muddy alluvial soil *w by the Ganges. Amidst pebbles of little value, interesting and curious specimens of cornelians, and stones even more precious, are occasionally found. The opposite district of Bundelkund is famous for diamonds, equalling in val) splendour those of the Golconda mines, aud in some parti cular spots they are found in considerable quantities. All below a certain weight are the property of the persons who may chance to \"gather them ; the larger sort belong to a rajah, who is bound to give a certain price in the event ot his claiming the privilege of purchase. The native method of gathering diamonds, which is the least expensive, and perhaps, on that account, the best, is very simple. A few labourers clear a convenient space on a rocky surface, and when it is laid bare, they bring buckets of earth from the places supposed to be the most thickly sown with the gems, and sifting it through their hands, easily find the diamonds, which, even in their rough state, are extremely luminous. The hire of the workman comprises the whole of the outlay, and diligent seekers frequently gather a rich harvest. The situation of Allahabad is healthy ; but either from its proximity to the two rivers, or the quantity of wood, which gives the surrounding country so luxuriant an appearance, it"], [239, "215 PILGRIMAGES TO ALLAHABAD. is more humid than any other place in the Dooab, and pos sesses a peculiar character of its own, the hot winds being considerably mitigated, and rain falling at seasons when other parts of the country are dry. The gardens are, in conse quence, very productive ; in those belonging to the British residents, artichokes in particular flourish, attaining a size unknown in less favourable soils in the neighbourhood. The rich tapestry of the jungles, those splendid creepers, which hang their fantastic wreaths upon every adjacent bough, are the great ornament of the pleasure-grounds of Allahabad. The native gardeners train them somewhat formally upon erect bamboos, whence they trail their magnificent garlands down to the ground, forming huge conical mounds. Allahabad affords a mournful example of the want of public spirit in the Mussulman population of its neighbour hood. A noble\"caravanserai, built by Sultan Khosroo, which forms a superb quadrangle, entered by four Gothic gateways, and surrounded by cloisters running along the four sides of a battlemented waU, the usual accommodation for travellers offered by an Indian hostel, has been permitted to fall into a state of deplorable decay. The garden adjoining, finely planted with mango-trees, is also in a neglected and dete riorated state. Three tombs, erected according to the fine taste displayed by the Mahomedans in the selection of the site of their mausoleums, in this garden, have, from the extraordinary solidity of their construction, escaped the destroying hand of Time. Allahabad, or at least the confluence of the rivers which belong to it, is held in high estimation by the Hindoos, being a place of pilgrim-resort. When a pilgrim arrives here, he sits down on the brink of the river, and has his head and body shaved, so that each hair may fall into the water ; the sacred writings promising him one million of years' residence in heaven for every hair thus deposited.

The steam-vessels which navigate the Ganges from Cal cutta terminate their voyage at Allahabad, as there, is not at all times sufficient water for a protracted trip. Since establishment, the commerce of Allahabad h: mich in. ed, and establishments have sprung up which expressly provide for the comfort of the traveller about to proceed downward hi tbe steamer, or higher up the country by boats (on the Jumna) or land conveyance. We close the river sketch here, and carry the traveller to other points by land. It is right however to say that, in sailing boats, one may go as far as Delhi, but the process is very tedious, occupying nearly three months from Allahabad. The road from Allahabad to Cawnpore is as monotonous as that to Allahabad, which, in all that respects scenery, it much resembles, with probably somewhat less of picturesque effect. At the town of Futtehpore, however, the curious in old buildings, of no very great antiquity, will be interested by the numerous remains of mosques, houses, serais of the Mussulman era, and of the severest kind of Mahomedan architecture. Futtehpore is a civil station, where two or three judicial and revenue functionaries reside, any one of whom will be glad to receive the passer-by if he prefers social intercourse to the sositude of the bungalow. Four stages"], [241, "217 CAWNPORE. from Futtehpore, one night's journey, hes Cawnpore, a large civil and military station. The description given by the late Miss Emma Roberts of this station is so exact, and applies, with slight variation, to so great a number of military stations throughout India, that we cannot do better than quote a portion from her interesting work on Hindostan.* It will save the necessity for much repetition, inasmuch as the \" bungalow,\" the \" compound,\" and the \" encampment,\" described by her, are nearly the same in every cantonment. \" Cawnpore is one of the principal stations of the mofussil, and is situated upon the right bank of the Ganges, about 600 miles from Calcutta. \" Nature has done little for Cawnpore ; but the sandy plain, broken occasionally into ravines, which forms its site, has been so much embellished by the hand of man, that any one but a soldier, not subjected to the miseries of field days, will say that it possesses much picturesque beauty. \" The great objection to the station is its want of concen tration ; the sines of the various regiments straggle to the distance of five miles along the river's bank, but the scene is thereby agreeably diversified, and the compounds (a corruption of the Portuguese word compania), which sur round the bungalows, are larger than could be the case if its limits were more circumscribed. Many of those compounds are beautifully planted, and have a very park-like appearance, particularly during the rainy season, when the cultivated parts of the plain have put on their green mantle. The prickly pear is greatly in request for fences ; and the tall aloe, frequently intervening, forms a magnificent embellish ment to the plantations. The houses at Cawnpore are, with veiy few exceptions, cutcha, that is, built of unbaked mud, and either choppered (thatched) or tiled ; but they are, generally speaking, extremely large and commodious. The plans of bungalows are various, but the most common consist of three centre rooms ; those opening on the front and back verandah being smaller than the one occupying the interior, wliich is casied the hall. These rooms communicate with * \" Scenes and Characteristics of Hindostan.\" 2 vols."], [242, "218 CAWNPORE. three others much narrower, on each side ; and at the soar corners are bathing-rooms, taken off the verandah, whicl stretches all round. The centre and largest room has only the borrowed light permitted by eight, ten, or twelve doors, leading out of the surrounding apartments ; these doors are always open, but some degree of privacy is obtained by a curl ain attached to each, of a sort of gauze- work, formed of bamboo spsit very fine, coloured green, and called these also serve to keep out the flies, while they adi and all the light considered nect- in Anglo-In who excludes glare, on the principle that it communicates heat to the apartment. Many of tbe Cawnpore hou < handsomely furnished, the chairs, tables, and sofas being of valuable wood, richly carved, with cushions and coverings of damask, or of Bareilly manufacture, black with gold flo resembling the japanned chairs, fashionable in England forty years ago. The floors, which are of chunam (finel) ten lime), are covered in the first instance with a mat I in in the second with a settringee, a peculiar manufact. the country, of an exceeding thick texture, and usually worn in shaded blue stripes ; or with calico printed in Brussels patterns, and so closely resembling a carpet, as to deceive all our practised eyes. This forms the general decoration of houses in the upper provinces. The exterior of a bungalow is usually very unpicturesque, bearing a strong resemblance to an overgrown barn ; the roof slopes down from an immense height to the verandah, and whatever be the covering, whether of tiles or thatch, it is equally ugly. In many places the cantonments present to the eye a succession of large conical roofs resting upon low pillars ; but in Cawnpore the addition of stone fronts to some of the houses, and of bowed ends to others, gives somewhat of architectural ornament to the station. \" The gardens rank amongst the finest in India. In con sequence of there being so many settled residents, they are much cultivated and improved ; all the European vegetables, with the exception of broad beans, come to great perfection during the cold season, and the grapes and peaches, which are not common to other stations, are particularly fine. The pine-apple does not grow in the upper provinces, but the mangoes, plaintains, melons, oranges, shaddocks, custard-apples,"], [243, "AN INDIAN CAMP. 219 limes, and guavas, are of the finest quality. These gardens, intermixed with forest trees, give Cawnpore a very luxuriant appearance ; it is an oasis reclaimed from the desert, for all around wastes of sand extend to a considerable distance. \" In the centre of the cantonments, and on the highest ground, are two stone buildings \u2014 the assembly-rooms and the theatre ; the latter a long oval, surrounded by a colon nade of pillars of the Roman Doric order, ornamental to the station, though not very well adapted to the purpose for which it was intended. \"Beyond the theatre, the road leads to the race-course, which is approached by an avenue weU planted on either side and watered during the dry season. This avenue forms the evening drive, and at sunset it is thronged with the society of the station. \" The course, as it is termed, skirts a wide plain, bounded to the right by the native city. The plain also affords a busy and interesting scene. Groups of natives are to be seen seated round their fires, cooking, eating, or singing after a repast ; and elephants and strings of home-bound camels, loaded with forage, sikewise occupy the ground. \" Cawnpore, though usually a gay station, is, of course, subject to the vicissitudes produced by the fluctuating state of Indian society. It cannot, however, be so much affected by party spirit, or the indisposition of leading residents to enter into amusements, as smaller places ; and amongst so many families, an agreeable circle must always be found. \" During the cold season, all the infantry corps forming the garrison of Cawnpore usually encamp upon a wide plain in the vicinity, for the convenience of better ground for the performance of msiitary evolutions than is to be found in the cantonments. An Indian camp affords a very striking and curious spectacle, and though the admixture of trees adds much to its beauty and heightens its effect, yet when, as at Cawnpore, it arises in the midst of an uncultivated desert, the singularity of the scene it presents compensates for the loss of the more pleasing features of the landscape. \" Regular streets and squares of canvas stretch over an immense tract ; each regiment is provided with its bazaar in the rear, and far beyond the lines, the almost innumerable camp-followers of every description form their bivouacs,"], [244, "220 CAWNPORE BA_. The tents of the commanding officers are indicated by small red flags. All th ofu lites are accustomed I portion of their time under canvas ; and in consequi the necessity of providing s moveable habitation, thi I few tents which do not boast more comfort than can 1\" imagined by those who are only acquainted with a Eur marquee. All are double, the interior and exterior cm. being about a foot and a half apart ; those which arc do poled contain several commodious apartments, and are fur nished with glass doors to fit into the openings. Tie usually lined with some gaily-coloured chintz ; the floorsa: covered with settriuges (carpets), and they have a convenient space enclosed at the rear by kanauts (a wall of canvas), for out-offices and bathing-rooms. Moveable stoves are sometimes provided for the cold weather, but there is a better contri vance, inasmuch as smoke is thereby avoided, in an imitation of tbe Spanish brassora. A large brass or copper ba common use, called a chillumchee, mounted on an iron tripod, is filled with red wood embers, and fuel thus pn p without having the deleterious effect of charcoal, diffuses a general warmth throughout the tent, and is very necessary in the evening; for though, during the cold is still too fierce at noon-day to confront without shelter, as soon as its rays are withdrawn, intense cold succeeds, a piercing wind sweeps along the plain, and the thermometer sinks below the freezing point. \" Cawnpore is well supplied with every article of European manufacture necessary for comfort, or even luxury, though it must be confessed that things are frequently too high-priced to suit subalterns' allowances. The bazaars are second to none in India, beef, mutton, fish, and poultry being of the finest quality. Vegetables of all kinds may be purchased by those who have not gardens of their own, there be. sufficient demand to induce the natives to cultivate exotics for the market. In addition to the shops kept by Europeans, there are many warehouses fitted with English and French goods, belonging to Hindoo and Mussulman merchants ; and the jewellers are scarcely inferior to those of Delhi \" Cawnpore is celebrated for the manufacture of saddlery, harness, and gloves ; though less durable than th English make, the cheapness and beauty of the two former"], [245, "LUCKNOW. 221 articles recommend them to the purchaser ; and the gloves offer a very respectable substitute for the importations from France. Prints of fashions supply the mantua-makers and tailors with ideas, and as there is no lack of materials, the ladies of Cawnpore are distinguished in the mofussil for a more accurate imitation of the toilettes of London and Paris than can be achieved at more remote stations.\" To the eastward of Cawnpore, distant 30 miles, is the principality of Oude, the capital of which is Lucknow. Lucknow (649 miles from Calcutta) is an old Mahomedan town, where some vestiges of ancient pomp may stisi be traced, and when the king sits in state, a scene is presented not unlike that which occurs at Delhi. The streets of Lucknow are long and mostly narrow, heaped with filth and abominations of all kinds ; but in the vicinity of the British residency, the streets are wider, the mosques and pagodas numerous and often handsome, and the road way well kept and watered. There are some striking edifices in and about Lucknow. The chief is the Imaumbarra or cathedral, erected to the memory of Azooph ud Dowlah. It consists of a series of buildings of great extent. There are two courts, one rising above the other. The outer court is divided from the inner one by three archways. In the latter is the tomb of the founder, \u2014 his turban and swovd being placed upon it. The shrine is always covered with a cloth, and is railed round with a brass enclosure, while a guard of native soldiers keep constant watch over the sacred spot, and four or five moollahs sit in the adjacent verandah perpetually reading the Koran. The whole of the external architecture of the Imaumbarra is of the Eastern Gothic style, and would present an idea of richness and variety, corresponding with the Kremlin of Moscow, were the mate rials of a superior quality to brick and chunam. Connected with this building, is the Rounee Durwaza, or Gate of Constantinople. According to some authors, it is a copy of a gate in the city of Sultan ; but the truth is, that in all Mahomedan towns, there are compliments to Room or Constantinople, and a gate supposed to face the direction of the Turkish metropohs is one of the most usual. The arch of the gate is of the Saracenic order. The tomb of Saadut Ali, a Nawaub of Lucknow, is another striking edifice. It"], [246, "222 STATE OF OUDE. is remarkable for a lofty dome seen from all parti ol tie city. Galleries within command a view of the shrine, and terraces without afford a prospect of the city aud surrounding country. About three miles from Lucknow, at Constalia, on the banks of the Goomtee, is the house and tomb of i Martine, a French adventurer, who, from the conditi I a private, rose to the rank of general, and acquired wealth and influence in Oude. The house, though built in question able taste, is of vast extent and good material. Tlie floors are of marble, the rooms large and lofty, the whole of the exterior wall of the inner rooms worked beautifully in mezzo relievo, with sculptured images tastefully di | The whole of the outer part of the erection is of stone, and numerous statues ornament it on either side. On the top most story is the tomb of Martine, adorned with sign: soldiers with their arms reversed, and bearing a very simple inscription. The ground surrounding the mansion is well laid out. Another of the suburban attractions of Lucknow, is the Dil Koosha, or \" Hearts' Delight.\" It is a palace belonging to the king, of some magnitude and beauty, richly furnished ; and attached to it, is an extensive park filled with game. There is a menagerie also within the park. The Nawaubs of Oude had always had a passion for wild beasts and their sports. Visitors to the palace of Lucknow arc invariably regaled with elephant and rhinoceros fights, quail combats, cocking, &c. A resident, or ambassador, here represents British interests, and a force is kept up, officered from the line of the Bengal army, which is charged upon the revenues of the Oude territory. There are very few made roads in the country, excepting a niisitary road which connects Cawnpore with Lucknow. The natives of Oude are naturally humane, aud exhibit a love of justice and forbearance ; but the principle of government, both in its protective and judicial functions, gives scope for cupidity, personal dislike, envy, vindictiveness, and all the worst passions of human nature. The adminis tration of the country is as bad as it is possible to conceive. The condition of Oude is yearly becoming worse. The re venue is gradually lessening. There are not less than 1 ' soldiers in the service of Zemindars. The revenue is col lected by half that number in the king's pay. The Aruils"], [247, "223 CARAVANSERAIS. and other pubhc officers, are men of no character, who obtain and retain their position by court bribery. Only the weak pay their revenue ; those who have forts, or who, by combi nations, can withstand the Amil, make their own revenue arrangements. Throughout the country, nothing exists deserving the name of a judicial or magisterial court. Not less than one hundred Dacoities, or other acts of violence, attended with loss of life, are annually reported, and hundreds take place which the corrupt news-writers are paid by the Amils never to report. The government dawk is sometimes attacked ; the British cantonment in the neighbourhood is attacked. In short, the government of the country is utterly falsified ; its constitution is altogether destroyed ; no hope remains. AU that can be done, is for the British to take the government in their own hands, preserving the king's rights and nominal authority, but placing the adminis tration in the hands of British officers. On the road from Cawnpore to Mynpooree we proceed through a level country, dotted with j heels or lakes, in which wild fowl abound. In this district many remains of magni ficent serais (caravanserais) attest the splendour of the Mahomedan dynasty. They are capacious, and chiefly of red brick, but have fallen into decay, the British government having taken no pains to repair and preserve them for the uses of native travellers, who are obliged to resort to very small modern serais, constructed of earth and bamboos. A methranee, or female sweeper, generally has the custody of these serais ; and a bunneeah, or grain seller, within the building, or in close vicinity thereto, disposes of pulse, atta, tobacco, and firewood to the applicant. The well-water at these rude hostelries is sweet and good ; and if the edifices themselves are not inviting, there are usually a few neem and peepul trees about them which afford an agreeable shade. At all the stages mentioned above there are small bazaars, well supplied, and good water. The road through the country is indifferent, owing to the sandy nature of the soil. Mynpooree. \u2014 A civil station of limited dimensions.

Our I it, by a vigorous assault, at daybreak. Great numbers were kisied in the attack, and the names of the officers of the 76th foot, which bore the brunt of the action, are engraven on the entablature of a small monument erected to t_M memory of the slain. Cawnpore to Agra. \u2014 Etawah. \u2014 Going westerly bon Cawnpore to Secundra, about forty miles, and then i westerly for- fifty more, Etawah is reached. This wa a flourishing place, the abode of oinraa and grandees of the Mogul empire, but it is now a mass of ruin and decay. Standing upon the banks of the Jumna, it |n splendid ghaut, which rather serves, by contrast with all else, to indicate the present poverty, than to sill ancient importance of the place. A few bungalow over a wide sandy plain nearly destitute of trees, inter with other buildings of an inferior kind, announce thi sence of civsi and misitary residents. These are, however, few in number \u2014 the one being limited to a collect' magistrate, with their subordinate officers, and the other to the wing of a corps of Native Infantry ; and as the ci > are only here occasionally, and the military detachn frequently relieved, no one appears to have a motive for rendering the houses comfortable. Nothing can be inn more dreary and desolate than this place as a residence ; bal for the naturalist it possesses attractions of no common order, the result, in a great measure, of the abundance of vegetation, arising from the absence of a large European population. In no other part of India, with the exception of the hill districts, are more brilliant and interesting specimens of birds and insects to be seen ; extremely small brown doves, with pink breasts, appear amid every variety of the common colour ; green pigeons, blue jays, crested woodpecker ther with an infinite number of richly-plumed birds, glowing in purple, scarlet, and yellow, less familiar to unscientific persons, flock around. The tailor-bird and the fly-catcher are also inhabitants of the gardens, which are visited by miniature birds resembling those of Paradise. Nothing can be more beautiful than the effect produced by the brilliant"], [249, "225 ETAWAH GARDENS. colours of these birds, which congregate in large flocks ; and by the flight of the ring-necked paroquets, and the byahs, or crested sparrows. Numbers of aquatic birds, too, feed upon the shores of the neighbouring Jumna. The roads round Etawah are bad ; they are the highways leading to the neighbouring stations, Mynpooree, Futtyghur, Agra, and Cawnpore, and afford no picturesque views. A few mango-groves, skirting vsilages surrounded by high walls of mud, probably as a security against the incursions of wild beasts, alone diversify the bare and arid plains, while the ruts threaten dislocation, and the dust is nearly suffocating. The gardens afford a more agreeable method of passing the short period of daysight which the climate will permit to be spent in the open air. They are large and well planted ; but the mallees (gardeners) are extremely ignorant of the European methods of cultivation, not having the same opportunity of acquiring knowledge as at larger stations. The pomegranate is of httle value, except for its rich red flowers ; for the fruit, when ripe, is crude and bitter. Sweet lemons, simes, oranges, and citrous, offer fruit of the finest quasity ; and grapes afford a grateful banquet, at a period of the year (the hot winds) in which they are most acceptable. The melons, which grow to a large size, and are abundant in the season, are chiefly procured from native gardens on the banks of the Jumna, as they flourish on the sands which border that river. Mangoes and jacks occupy extensive plantations, exclusive of the gardens, and are left, as well as custard-appies, plantains, guavas, to the cultivation of the natives, the ground in the neighbourhood of a bungalow being chiefly appropriated to foreign productions. The seeds of European vegetables are sown after the rainy season, and come to perfection during the cold weather. Green peas, cauliflowers, and cos lettuce appear at Christmas, sustaining, without injury, night-frosts which would kill them in their native climes ; but celery, beet-root, and carrots never attain to their proper size, and are frequently deficient in flavour. The oleanders, common all over India, are the pride of the jungles, spreading into large shrubs, and giving out their delicate perfume from clusters of pink and white flowers. The baubool also boast scent of the most exquisite nature. v"], [250, "226 AGRA. The sensitive plant grows in great abundance in 1 1 of Etawah, spreading itself over whole borders.

The appearance of the city from the river is picturesque, without being imposing ; the houses on the banks having a mean appearance, whilst their regularity is broken by trees and jutting banks. A fine strand road was constructed by the labour of the destitute poor during a famine that prevail - It is eighty feet wide, and affords a noble promene< crowds of pedestrians, who resort there in the evening, and is very convenient also for the landing of goods, &c. Seve ral of the more opulent natives have adorned it with stone ghauts, which in the rainy season afford the inhabitants an easy access to the stream, and enable them to enjoy the luxury of bathing, offering libations, &c. <fcc. During the hot months, however, the bed of the river, next the town, is entirely dry ; the channel being on the opposite bank, dis tant nearly half a mile. The city extends about four miles in length, and about three in depth ; the houses are built chiefly of the red sandstone, which is procured in abundance from some neighbouring hills to the south. There is one fine broad street, which runs through the middle of the city, extending from the fort to the Padree tank : several of the houses in it are three and four stories high ; most of the other streets are very narrow, but they are for the most part kept very clean. During the day the main street is thronged with passengers, and there is an appearance of much bustle and business, but, with the exception of a few merchants and bankers, the inhabitants are generasiy very poor. The"], [251, "227 PRODUCTIONS OF AGRA. shops contain very few articles ; many of them are small cabins of about eight feet square, and contain goods in pro portion. In the centre of the city is the cutwallee, posice office, which is in a very efficient state, so that there are rarely any disturbances, whilst order, safety, and a cheerful tranquillity appear to prevasi. From the fort there is a good road, though somewhat steep, leading to the cantonment, both considerably elevated above the level of the river. Here the military and the greater proportion of the Chris tian residents are located, whsist the civilians and writers in the pubsic offices are in an opposite direction, with an inter vening space of at least three msies, and in some instances five. Very few Europeans choose to live in the city, on account of its closeness and insalubrity. The cantonments on the other hand are very open, and the bungalows are situated in the midst of extensive compounds, some of which are converted into beautiful gardens ; these gardens, how ever, are rendered as useful as they are ornamental, for almost asi the vegetables obtainable in the place are of our own produce. There is no regular market for the sale of these necessaries. A few greens (turai), melons, cucumbers, and occasionally causifiowers, are produced, but there is no dependence upon regular suppsies ; and as for peas, asparagus, turnips, beans, and other table vegetables, they are scarcely ever cultivated by the native mallees (gardeners). The great obstacle, however, to the more general culture of gar dens is the scarcity of good water. With but few excep1 tions, the wells in Agra contain brackish water, and this proves fatal to asi but a very few vegetable productions. But even when good water is procurable, the expense of water ing and gardening is very considerable. A pair of bullocks and their keepers cost ten or twelve rupees a month ; three or four mallees cost as much more. There is a want at Agra of farm produce, such as poultry, eggs, butter, butcher's meat ; the latter article is generally so inferior, that almost every individual kills his own mutton. The roads of Agra have been much improved within the last few years \u2014 simestone, instead of pounded brick, being now used. It makes a hard and durable road, which resists the pressure of carriage wheels, and becomes more compact by rain. There are large beds of this material found in the Q 2"], [252, "228 ARCHITECT!.

The cupolas surmounting the b trades have still remains of that beautiful mazarin blue enamel which decks all the principal ruins, but the con tion of which is now unknown. On the same road, a little to the right, is a spacious tank, now dry. It measures at least between 300 and 400 feet square, and in the centre of each of the sides, a flight of steps leads to the bed ; over these piazzas are constructed, and at each corner, small towers of an octagonal form. The style of architecture of the gene rality of the Agra buildings is very heavy and destitute of grace. There is often exquisite beauty and elaboration in the details, but a sombre massiveness in the Um which would seem to insinuate that th_ Lr design was less ior comfort than durability, \u2014 less for enjoyment than for fame.

The tarnarind-tree is particularly admired, not only for its shade, but for the beauty and delicacy of its foliage ; whilst under"], [253, "CLIMATE OF AGRA. 229 the broad covering of the pecpul leaves, which, whilst they effectually screen the fiery rays of the King of Day, also produce, by their motion, a most refreshing coolness. The baubool is abundant, and is much used for hackery wheels, carts, and sometimes for rough furniture, as it is not liable to split. A species of wine is also made from its bark, which is much drunk by Kaiths and some other castes. The sissoo is a highly valuable wood for doors and windows, but is very scarce, and yields to the more abundant saul. The climate of Agra, during the hot winds which prevasi from April to July, is truly distressing ; but the rains which fall, and which in regular seasons continue till October, cool the air most refreshingly. From the 1st of October, the misty mornings usher in, though by slow degrees, the cold season. In December, fires are lighted, and afford to cold subjects, not only comfortable warmth, but still more grateful remi niscences of home. Every one at this season of the year seems cheerful and revived. The scenery of nature is also irradiated with brightness and verdure. The holyoak, the balsam, and the refulgent marigold, enliven the gardens, whilst beds of mignonette and rows of the Indian myrtle perfume the atmosphere. Vegetables are now nearly fit for the table. Early peas, carrots, turnips, asparagus, artichokes, cauliflowers, French beans, are all in season, but in January they become more abundant. In February the air is most bland and balmy ; it is the spring weather of England, and the lovely peach and apple blossoms unfold their delicate petals to the breeze. There are very few birds remarkable for the beauty of their plumage or the sweetness of their song. Parrots, minas, pigeons, doves, swallows, avadavats, piddis (a little bird simsiar to the last), kites, crows, and sparrows, adjutants, vultures, and the petted peafowls, nearly make up the whole of the specimens of the winged tribe. Public Edifices. \u2014 The desire of posthumous fame seems to be quite a passion among the inhabitants of the East. This feeling is chiefly gratified in the structure of magnificent tombs and temples. India abounds with them, and in the district of Agra there are some of the choicest specimens. Amongst these, surpassingly pre-eminent is the Taj Mehal, built by Shah Jehan, the King of the World, for his beau tiful Queen, Moomtaza Zumanee, the Light of the World."], [254, "230 THE TAJ MUHAL. Every peer has his tomb, and they are numerous in and about Agra ; they are often found in the compounds of our bungalows, and any attempt to remove them would I lowed by a remonstrance from the Emaums. The taj seems as fresh and almost as perfect as when it was just finished. The joinings of the marble slabs of which the exterior is composed are so close and compact, that not a fibre of vegetation is to be seen pressing from between them, nor does the rain or atmosphere have any effect in staining its polished surface. Another striking feature in this building is the admirable finish with whioE o\\ erything about it is executed : every device is chaste and ipriate. The arches of the doors are neither pure nor Gothic, but allow of greater breadth than either, and are yet equally susceptible of strength. Under the central dome is a kind of octagonal palisade richly fretted, and within this are the tombs of the emperor and his empress ; both exceedingly beautiful, and covered with a profusion of flowers \u2014 ornaments composed of various coloured stones let in; \u2014 they are chiefly agates, cornelians, and blood-stone. Underneath these tombs is a vault where there are two other tombs of a plainer construction \u2014 on these garlui flowers are constantly placed, and generally a light burn ing : on the panels or lower parts of the walls, flowers are carved in alto relievo. Nothing can be more graceful or perfect than the forms of these flowers ; all is waving and natural, there is not the slightest degree of st i \u25a0 or bad drawing in them. The natives are, with good reason, proud of this unique specimen of the fine arts, but it is scarcely a matter of doubt that the entire and superintendence were those of Italian artists. Bishop Heber immediately recognised, in the fretwork especially, pure Florentine art ; and that there were Italians at Agra at the time, and even long before, is evident from their i being still extant in the Roman Catholic burying-ground : the dates of some, still legible, are within 1600 and 1650. The beauty of this mausoleum has attracted the attention of many visitors, but none have done it such perfect justice as the author of the following sketch :\u2014 \" I have been to visit the taj. I have returned, full of emotion. My mind enriched with visions of ideal beauty. When first I approached the taj, eleven years ago, I was dis-"], [255, "231 THE TAJ MUHAL. appointed. In after days, when my admiration for the love liness of this busiding had grown into a passion, I have often inquired, why this should have been? And the only answer I can find is, that the symmetry is too perfect to strike at first. It meets you as the most natural of objects. It therefore does not startle, and you return from it disappointed that you have not been startled. But it grows upon you in all the harmony of its proportions, in all the exquisite deli cacy of its adornment ; and at each glance, some fresh beauty or grace is developed. A_nd, besides, it stands so alone in the world of beauty. Imagination has never con ceived a second taj, nor had anything simsiar ever before occurred to it. \" View the taj at a distance ! It is as the spirit of some happy dream, dwelling dim, but pure, upon the horizon of your hope, and reigning in virgin supremacy over the visible circle of the earth and sky. Approach it nearer, and its grandeur appears unlessened by the acuteness of its fabric, and swelling in asi its fresh and fairy harmony, until you are at a loss for feelings worthy of its presence. Approach stdl nearer, and that which, as a whole, has proved so charming, is found to be equally exquisite in the minutest detasi. Here are no mere touches for distant effect. Here is no need to place the beholder in a particular spot to cast a partial light upon the performance, \u2014 the work which dazzles with its elegance at the coup d'\u0153il will bear the scrutiny of the microscope. The sculpture of the panels, the fretwork and mosaic of the screen, the elegance of the marble pavement, the perfect finish of every jot and iota, as if the meanest architect had been one of those potent Gensi, who were of yore compesied to adorn the palaces of necromancers and kings. \" We feel, as our eye wanders around this hallowed space, that we have hitherto lavished our admiration and our lan guage in vain. We dread to think of it With feelings which workmanship less exquisite has awakened, and we dare not use, in its praise, language hackneyed in the service of every day minds. We seek for it a new train of associations, a fresher range of ideas, a greener and more sacred corner in the repository of our heart. And yet, wherefore should this be, since no terms applying to other works of beauty, except ing the most general, can be appropriated here 1 For those"], [256, "232 THE GARDEN OF THE TAJ. there be phrases, established by usage, which ti okasifii of style render intelligible to all vrith similar works of art. But in the taj, we fall o new and separate creation ; which never con since it never can be imitated. It is like some bright and newly-discovered winged thing, all beauteous in a I peculiar to itself, and referable to no class or Ol roll of zoology, which the whole world flocks to gaze upon with silent delight \u2014 none presuming to designate the stranger, nor to conjecture a kindred for it with the \\\\ things of the earth.

It is the spirit of the taj, tl - inspired love, which called into being this peerless wonder of the world, and elaborated its symmetry and composed its harmony, and eddying around its young minarets and domes, blended them without a line into the azure of immensity.\" The garden of the taj is also an object of great attraction; it is intersected by wide paths, paved with flagstones, and even those are arranged in fanciful devices. The avenue of cypress-trees, with a row of fountains between them, which still play on Sundays, is particularly fine ; there is besides, in the centre of this avenue, a marble reservoir about forty feet square, in which there are five additional fountains, one in the centre and one at each corner. There are but few flowers in the garden, and but a scanty supply of fruit-trees, the vine being the principal ; but there is a collection of noble trees of gigantic size, which afford a delightful shade, and admit of a pleasant walk even in the middle of the day."], [257, "233 FORT AND PALACE. The Rham Bhag garden, wliich is across the water (and wliich is said once to have contained a tomb similar to the taj, for the ashes of Shah Jehan himself), is nearly of the same size as that of the taj, but it is not so regular nor elaborate. Many, however, prefer it on this account, and on account also of the greater variety of fruit and flowers, and particularly of groves of orange-trees, with which it abounds. At both these public gardens there are plain accommodations for invalids, and such as are in search of the picturesque. Parties often spend an agreeable week at these places. The fort of Agra is one of the grandest in India. It occupies a large space of ground on the banks of the river, and within its lofty embattled walls are the palace, the Motee Musjid, the arsenal, and numerous compartments for all the paraphernalia of war. The fort, however, is far from being strong, and would soon fall under an assault from a few long sixteen-pounders. The remains of the palace, with its gilded cupolas, and the rich tracery in gold and blue enamel on the walls and roofs of the principal rooms, show what they must have been when occupied by royalty. The arsenal is very tastefully adorned with warlike instruments. There is a broad wet ditch with drawbridges at convenient stations around the outer wasi. There are also two terraces of considerable breadth, where a large body of troops might be paraded. The Motee Musjid, or Pearl Sanctuary, is one of the most unique things of the kind ever witnessed. It is made of pure marble, and has a dazzling white appearance : the floor of the musjid is paved with rows of slabs, each of which constitutes an altar, on which the faithful sons of the Prophet present their offerings of praise. Just outside of the fort, there is another immense psie called the Jumma Musjid, whither also the Moslems resort for prayer. The architecture of this building is described as possessing much merit. It has three domes of nearly the same size, and the terrace is surmounted with towers and minarets at the centres and corners ; but the whole building is rapidly decaying, and immense pieces of stone appear ready to fall from their giddy heights. Secundra is a part of the suburbs of Agra, and derives its name from the celebrated Alexander. In this spot is the mausoleum of the most celebrated of the Mahomedan kings,"], [258, "234 AGRA COLLEGE. the great Akbar. This remarkable edifice is still in a high state of preservation ; the foundation is supported on large massive arches twelve feet thick. The ground-floor rests on a plinth of immense area, and a piazza of prodigious st i runs all round the building : here in the cold season parties frequently resort to enjoy the salubrious air, aud th. sores of an English garden. There are at Agra very few modern public buildings of any note ; the only ones that have been built for publi poses are two extensive offices for the political and revenue departments, and two wings to the Government House. To the above works of the executive officer may be added a handsome new steeple to the church, the conversion of the Nya Kee Mondee Hospital, an old native building, into a decent modern-looking house, and last, though not least, the Metcalfe Testimonial, winch, although deficient in architectural points, possesses considerable beauty of exterior. The most striking of all the public buildings is1 the College, situated in the civil lines, and at a short distance from the town. It is a noble quadrangle, and in the Gothic style, with jutting corners, having four turrets at each of the corners, and two loftier ones flanking the two principal entrances. There are arched verandahs on each side, four handsome entrances, and four corner quadrangular rooms. A passage runs from north to south through the building, and on either side there are seven spacious rooms, including the centre hall, which is divided into two parts. The southern side of the braiding is appropriated to the verna cular department, and the northern to the English. The number of pupils attached to the former exclusively is about 120, to the latter 140. The Oriental languages taught are Sanscrit and Hindee, Arabic, Persian, Urdu ; and arithmetic. The English instruction embraces history, poetry, morals, positical economy, natural phsiosophy, mathematics, tfec. T_M funds for the support of the college are derived from a num ber of vsilages bequeathed by a wealthy Zemindar, and yield about 2,000 rupees a month, or near 25,000 rupees a year ; the monthly expenditure, independently of the prin cipal's salary, is about 1,200 rupees. The Government House is about three miles and a half from the cantonments, but conveniently situated in the"], [259, "235 CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS. vicinity of the principal public offices, such as the Political and Revenue departments, the Civsi Auditor's, the Judge's cutcherry, and that necessary appendage to social existence, the jasi. The magistrate's cutcherry is situated between the civil lines and cantonments. Nearly opposite is the Agra press. One of the most useful and most prosperous insti tutions in Agra is the bank. For a considerable time its operations were veiy simited, and confined chiefly to loans to the military ; but its transactions have since been much extended, and it is now casied the Agra and United Service Bank. The Metcalfe Testimonial, in honour of Sir Charles (after wards Lord) Metcalfe, who was for some time Lieut. -Governor of Agra, is but one of the many tributes that have been paid to one of the most experienced and popular governors of India. There are two long and beautiful hasis for dancing and supper, and a sibrary intervening. The Church is a spacious and handsome building, calculated to hold from 800 to 1,000 persons. There is also a Baptist chapel, wliich is generally well attended, but chiefly among the East-Indian community, and a chapel of ease is building. Agra boasts of several charitable institutions. The Bene volent Institution supports and educates nearly three hundred native children, who are taught various arts, such as carpet-making, weaving, sewing, carpentry, smithery, shoemaking, gardening, ifec. The Relief Society affords alms to the blind, lame, and indigent poor. The Government Dispensary supplies medical aid to the native sick. There is a Church Missionary Society at the station, supported by the Parent society in England. It has originated several native schools, in and about the town, where instruction is given in the vernacular languages, the Bible being the principal class-book. Seventy-four miles clue south of Agra, stands Gwasior, a fortified town, forming the seat of Scirdar's government. Gwalior (805 miles from Calcutta) is approached by a footpath, over some trifling clay and sandstone heights, from which it is seen to advantage, lying under the wing of the giant stronghold, which rises in a complete precipice from its veiy bosom ; and interspersed with trees and minarets, after the usual fashion of native cities. The suburbs are somewhat"], [260, "236 GWALIOR. scanty, and there is no wall of del- e town ; however, by means of strong portals connecting the parallel streets, and opening or closing the commune .: pleasure of the inhabitants, as well as by the external gates, is capable of making a brief defence ag any irregular attack. These gateways are singularly el although a jumble of modern and Hun I They are built of sandstone. The gateway itself i a archi trave of stone, supported upon ornamented columns same. Above this rises the pointed Saracenic arch, and above that are elegant arabesque bas-reliefs, the roof of tin structure being flat. The Juuima Musjid isa handsome building, in the style of those at Lucknow. On turning the flank of the defences, we come upon the grandest and most imposing exhibition of military architecture ever beheld. We doubt if the world contains anything so magnificent as this long line of Gothic towers, scarped by an overhanging precipice ; poised in mid air, dignified by the impress of the ages that have passed over their heads, yet unimpaired in strength and beauty, and presenting, not the bsind aspect of mere holds of power, in which a garrison is pent up and excluded from the world, but that of the fittest possible residence for an sovereign. It is not possible to give anything like an adequat of this surpassing fortress without the aid of the colours. The cliff upon which it stands is perfectly perpen dicular, formed, apparently, of sandstone, and it extenth round the entire circuit of the fortified height. The defences, which, on the other sides, though adequate t object, are dwindled into comparative insignificance by immediate contrast with the massive hill on which they stand, are here of the noblest dimensions and the most grace ful form, being a series of circular towers, closely connected by curtains of nearly similar height, and roofed-in with small domes of masonry ; the whole having, in addition to shot holes, embrasures, &c, an abundance of glazed windows, betokening the dwelling of rational creatures ; while the masonry itself is adorned with glazed tiles, which, whatever their effect when recent, retain at present only those tints which become a venerable fabric, and that fabric of the"], [261, "237 BHURTPORE AND JEYPORE. Gothic style. The entire circuit of these defences is about three miles, their form an oblong rectangle. The summit of the height, as is usual in the sand formation, is nearly flat. The height of the precipice is about 200 feet, and the height from the foot of the precipice to the level of the town about 200 feet more, making a total height of about 400 feet.' In the steepest face of the csiff\", at the north aspect and north-east angle, are several caves, probably communicating by subterranean galleries with the interior. One, in particular, contams a gigantic image of Pars Nath, distinctly visible from beneath. These caves may be convenient to the garrison during a siege, but are extremely dangerous to the safety of the place, as a single ten-inch shell would, by exploding within the cavity, in all probability, bring down the whole of the north-east angle, which is, even now, over hanging the perpendicular. They appear, however, to be intended as temples rather than posts of observation. Of the city of Gwalior little need be said. With every facility for building at hand, it possesses few edifices that can attract the attention, and, for the capital of a large state, is very far below mediocrity in every respect, whether we regard the narrowness of its simits, the poverty of its streets and buildings, or the almost entire want of that appearance of busy traffic which characterises all important towns under the British government. Indeed, there is httle temptation to the import of merchandise into a country so infested with open robbers, and with every species of extortion under the plea of customs. The residency at Gwalior is a mean building, and scarcely any sort of state has been kept up by the British representa tive. It has only been on the occasion of a visit of ceremony from the Governor- General to the Maharajah, that the place has presented any scenes of pomp. Bhurtpore, Jeypore, and Ajmeer. \u2014 In a direct line west of Agra lie the small native states of Bhurtpore, Jeypore, and Ajmeer. Ajmeer is somewhat to the south of the Shekawattee country, an extensive desert, divided into several chieftainships, which have sworn allegiance to the British government, but which invariably exhibit a \" moody frontier\" when the time arrives for the payment of the usual tribute. The Shekawattee country extends to Bhutseer, which borders the Cis-Sutledge provinces."], [262, "238 AJMEER, BHURTPORE, ETC. Ajmeer (1,030 miles from Calcutta) was once a large and populous city, and occasionally the residence ol the ei of Delhi. It was nearly ruined during the disorders which followed on the rise of the Mahratta power, but sii transfer to the British, it has greatly improved. There are political officers at Ajmeer, Jeypore brigade of irregular troops, to act against the 81 chieftains when occasion calls for the exercise of force ; but we have no regular troops nearer to the country than at Nusserabad, a large cantonment south-east of Ajmeer, where a regiment of cavalry and three or four infantry corps are quartered. Bhurtpore (878 miles from Calcutta) is the capital of one of the Jhat chieftainships. Its reputation is cousitl for Lord Lake was baffled in his attempt to capture the fort in 1805; but it fell to the British arms, when assailed by Lord Combermere in 182G, and was restored by our gt ment to its lawful chief, from whom it had been wrested. Proceeding from Agra to Delhi, the route runs parallel with the right or western bank of the river Jumna. Tin distance is 134 nules, through a flat, cultivated country which the debris of Mahomedan greatness are scattered. Jeypore is the capital of the principality of Ajmeer. It is one of the handsomest and most regularly buiit towns in India, many of its streets being equal in appearance to those of European cities. Muttra (875 msies from Calcutta) was once a military cantonment, but of late years it has been abandoned by the government, to the infinite loss of the officers, who had btult or purchased houses there, and were, consequently, obliged to sacrifice them (no successors appearing), the government making them no compensation for the loss. Delhi (97G miles from Calcutta). \u2014 As the ancient seat of the Mogul empire, and the modern residence of the pensioner who still rejoices in the empty title of king, this is one of the most interesting towns in India. It stands in the middle of a plain, surrounded on every side with the ruins of the ancient metropolis, and the tasteful villas of the Europeans, who now exercise the business of local government. The site of these latter was once occupied by the famed gardens of Shasimar. Couched under a ridge of sandstone rocks,"], [263, "239 DELHI. called the Mijnoon Pahar, sie the military cantonments \u2014 an alternation of bungalows, huts, and groups of gaudy trees. The city of Delhi is enclosed by a wall or rampart of red granite, battlemented and turreted, and wearing, in the distance, a more formidable appearance than is borne out by closer inspection. Mosques, minarets, and cupolas, enamesied and gsided, intermingle with clusters of cypresses, and present a pleasing and perfectly Oriental aspect, when the town is contemplated from the distance. Within the city, the magnificence of the ancient edifices realizes the conception formed from the view without. The spacious regal palace \u2014 the marble hasi of audience (now stripped of its former gsiding and the peacock throne), bearing the inscription immortalized in Moore's \"Lasia Rookh\"* \u2014 the Jumma Musjid, or principal mosque, <fcc., \u2014 asi vouch for the splendid concep tions and exquisite taste of the emperors of the olden time. The principal street, or Chandney Choke, is a Regent Street in its way ; it is broad and handsome ; the architecture of the houses is varied, and fronted by trees, which form a beautiful avenue. As the king keeps up a certain degree of state, and maintains the royal privilege of conferring khillauts, or dresses of honour, the wealthier natives affect the airs of an aristocracy, and attempt, by gaiety of costume and a swaggering indifference, to impress people with an idea of their importance. They are also active in their endeavours to imitate the chiefs and Omrah of old by the practice of petty political intrigues, in which they find active participa tors amongst the corrupt inhabitants of the imperial palace. His majesty, the pensioner, sometimes emerges from his residence on his elephant, attended by a rabble of retainers ; and on these occasions largesse is distributed to the crowd, and his name and titles are shouted by those who precede and surround him. The works of the Europeans at Delhi are confined to a magnificent canal, an arsenal, where the implements and munitions of war are prepared, when occasion requires, on a grand scale ; a church, a college, and a printing-press.

Exhaustion speedily fosiows, the breath and limbs fail, and, if long exposed to the scorching air, the skin wsil peel off. Yet this is the period chosen by the natives for their journeys and revehies ; they cover their faces with a cloth, and with this simple precaution brave the fiercest blasts of the simoom. These winds usuasiy subside at sunset, though they sometimes blow to a later hour, and are known to continue all night. If they should change to the eastward, the tatties are useless, producing only a hot damp steam. In this event, the only means of mitigating the heat is to exclude the wind by filling up the crevices, hanging thick curtains (purdahs) over the doors, and setting asi the punkahs in motion : inefficient expedients, for, in despite of all, the atmosphere is scarcely bearable, excessive and continual thirst, languor of the most painful nature, and irritability produced by the prickly heat, render existence almost insupportable. Every article of furniture is burning to touch ; the hardest wood, if not well covered with blankets, wisi split with a report hke that of a pistol, and linen taken from the drawers appears as if just removed from a kitchen fire. The nights are terrible, every apartment being heated to excess. Gentlemen usually have their beds placed in the verandahs, or on the chubootiar, or terrace on the top of the house, as they incur little risk in sleeping in the open air at a season in which no dews fasi, and there is scarcely any variation in the thermometer. Tornadoes are frequent during the hot winds ; while they last, the skies, though cloudless, are darkened with dust, the sun is obscured, and a London fog cannot more effectu ally exclude the prospect. The birds are dreadful sufferers at this season ; their wings droop, and their bsils are open as if gasping for breath ; all animals are more or less affected. The breaking-up of the hot winds affords a magnificent spectacle ; they depart in wrath, aster a tremendous conflict' with opposing elements. The approaching strife is made known by a cloud, or rather a wasi of dust, which appears at the extremity of the horizon, becoming more lofty as it advances. The air is sultry and still, for the wind which is tearing up the sand as it rushes along, is not felt in front of the bisiowy masses, whose mighty ramparts gather strength as they spread.

North-eastward of Delhi is Meerut. Meerut (871 miles from Calcutta) is a large station for civil and msiitary establishments ; it is the residence of a civil commissioner, a judge, a magistrate, a collector of land revenue, and asi their assistants. A regiment of European cavalry, one of infantry, one of native cavalry, and three of native infantry, besides horse and foot artillery, are cantoned here ; and as the parading ground is extensive and good opportunities are afforded for working the three arms of the service together. Meerut is a particularly healthy station. Close to Meerut is Sirdanah. formerly the residence of the celebrated Begum Sumroo, who bequeathed her wealth"], [267, "243 ALMORAH. to the son of her late husband (Dyce Sombre as he was caUed). Here also is a Catholic* cathedral. Between Meerut and Delhi and the river Sutledge, are the military stations of UmbaUah, Loodiana, and Ferozepore, differing from each other only in the scenery of their respec tive locasities. They have the characteristics of asi msiitary stations in common, and the country which hes between them corresponds essentially with that on the routes between Allahabad and Asiyghur. Level land, mud vsilages, ruined serais, decayed mosques and temples, plots of cultivation, groves, (fee, occur at frequent intervals ; while strings of laden camels, howda-burdened elephants, gaily-caparisoned horses, detachments of troops, mark an activity of life peculiar to a misitary state, where the arts of peace have not been extensively cultivated. Due north of Meerut stands Seharunpore, a station for a cosiector and magistrate, a judge and a regiment of infantry. Here is a Botanic Garden, where the hardier plants, the pro ductions of Europe, and the tea of China are, cultivated with much skill and good effect. Forty msies from Seharunpore, north-east, is the vasiey of the Dhoon. Dehra (992 miles from Calcutta) is the principal place in the valley. It is one of the most salubrious spots in India. Cultivation of the staples of India is here carried ion upon an extensive scale ; and many retired and invalid officers make it their place of residence, in preference to returning to England. The Sirmoor battalion of Goorka sepoys gene rasiy has its head-quarters here. One hundred and fifty miles eastward of Seharunpore is Almorah, in the province of Kumaon. Almorah is the principal military station in this part of the Himalayan range. It is 5,400 feet above the level of the sea. When we first took these hisis, a considerable force was stationed at Almorah, with a permanent commandant and a major of brigade ; but it is now much diminished. There are good and numerous roads here, one from the foot of the hills at Bhamaurie (four marches) to Almorah ; another to Havsi Bagh, the cantonment of the Kumaon (civil) local battasion, which is about six miles from Almorah ; another to Lohooghat, four marches, and on, through that R 2"], [268, "244 ALMORAH. place, three more to Petora-Ghur ; also one from Lohooghat to Birmdeo, the pass by which the lulls are entered from Psisibheet, three marches, besides roads for taking air aud exercise about Almorah. At each of the military stations in these lulls, are forts, one at Almorah, called \" Fort Moira ;\" one at Lohooghat, \" Fort Hastings ;\" and one at Petora-Ghur, denominated \" Fort London,\" as, likewise, at the latter place, a small fortified house, or tower, designated \" Wilkie-Ghur,\" after Major James Wsikie, who had the busiding of the forts at Petora and Lohooghat. In a msiitary point of view, how ever, these forts are all worthless, none of them containing \u25a0water, or even commanding that near them. There are stage-bungalows all the way from Bhamaurie to Almorah, for the use of which travesiers pay one rup diem. The Kumaon local corps stationed at Havil-Bagh is, as well as asi the other hill-corps, armed with fuzils, and dressed in green, with black facings. At Almorah there are five bungalows, called sick bunga lows, belonging to government ; these are kept in good repair, and are exclusively for the use of such officers as may come up on sick leave, who are furnished with one to sive in, free of asi cost, on appsication, through the executive officer, in whose charge they are, to the officer commanding. It is only surprising, considering this, that more officers do not go there for their health, where they not only get a house (and that a good one) to live in, and medical attend ance gratis, but also everything else they can require very much cheaper than at Simla. The sick-houses are, of course, totally unfurnished. As to climate, though not so cold as at Simla, Almorah is sufficiently cool and pleasant, and it is, unquestionably, a very healthy, renovating one. In regard to society, likewise, there is a sufficiency. The military cantonments are at the western extremity of, and close to, the city of Almorah, which is the capital of the province, and, in fact, the only place in the hUls that can be casied a city. Prior to our invasion and conquest of Kumaon, Almorah was the place of residence of the Goorka vieeroy, who was appointed from Katmandoo ; and previous to the Goorka invasion, it was the seat of government of tbe Rajahs of Kumaon. From the nature of its situation, the"], [269, "THE HIMALAYAS. 245 city is principally composed of one long street, of nearly a mile in length, though there are suburbs which extend down a long way on both sides of the hsil. It is paved with stone throughout, and the houses are generally very good, none being under two stories, and many three and four stories high ; the houses, even of the poorest people, in this part of the hsils, are asi bmlt of stone, and have slatedj roofs, so that they are remarkably substantial. Indeed, those in the town of Almorah are unlike anything seen in the plains of India, and remind one somewhat of England, to a small town in which country Almorah has altogether a greater resemblance than to one in Hindostan. The officer commanding at Almorah has, also, the general command of asi the troops in the district. The Himalayas. \u2014 The range of the Himalaya, of which Almorah forms a link, embraces an area of 500,000 to 600,000 square miles. It consists of numerous ridges running parasiel to the direction of the whole range from south-east to north-west, which are connected in many places by transverse ridges, and in others separated by deep and narrow ravines and glens, in which the different branches and tributary rivers of the Indus and Ganges run. The entire chain, from the Hindoo Koosh, near Cabul, to the easternmost valleys of .Assam, is overtopped by an elevated range covered with eternal snow. The lowest chain of the mountains, immediately skirting the plains of India, is extremely picturesque and diversified. The sides of the mountains are covered with dwarf trees, or cultivation on smasi patches of tableland, formed by cutting the sloping earth into a series of terraces, resembling vast flights of steps. The vasieys are extremely narrow, consisting of sittle else than the bed of a rivulet, or a rude road, and the habi tations of the people, generally on elevated ground, few and far between. As we advance, by roads cut in the mountain sides, the lulls assume a bolder and severer aspect. Steep sides, sometimes wooded by the pine and the oak, but more frequently composed only of vast faces of naked rock, dip down abruptly, forming huge chasms and ravines, through which the torrent forces itself over rude fragments, which have toppled from the summits to the deep abyss. The roads now become narrow paths, winding along the edges of pre cipices, and the rustic bridge is supplanted by rude sangas,"], [270, "246 SIMLA. or planks, or by jhulaa, formed by ropes stretched across, constituting a species of loose parapet, and supporting a light ladder for the feet to rest upon. These mountains are seldom crossed by Europeans. The Tibetan traders visit Upper India by tbe northern passes, and ii \u25a0 takes place with the vasiey of Nepal, and the countries of Assam and Bootau ; but in all other respects, tho mountain regarded as the natural frontier of the British possessions, and are only penetrated as far, or as high, as may be requisite for purposes of health. Next to Mussoorie, spoken of above, the favourite places of resort are Simla, not many msies from Rampore, the chief town in the vasiey of the Upper Sutledge ; and to the south-east, in the vicinity of the Nepalese territory. Simla. \u2014 The climate of Simla is considered one of the finest in the world. The thermometer, within doors, sel ranges higher than 62\u00b0 Fahrt. except in the months of May, June, and July, when it rarely exceeds 72\u00b0. June, July, and August, comprise the rainy months ; and during the remaining portion of the year the climate is deli;: Snow seldom falls until January, and except on the north side of the hills, does not he above two or three days on the ground. The sudden changes of temperature which are occasioned by the alternate winds of the plains and of the snowy ranges, are not of frequent occurrence ; hot winds are unknown ; and the weather is not so variable as else where on the Himalaya range. On the hills of Simla there are upwards of one hundred residences, busit after the fashion of English cottages. As the chosen retreat of Go vernors-General and Commanders-in-Chief, from the burning plains of India, the place has enjoyed for some years past many considerable advantages. The roads to the residences, and for some distance beyond them, are spacious and elegant, Shopkeepers have been induced to estabhsh themselvi form emporiums of all the creature comforts. There is a reading-room and billiard-table, an amateur theatre, a church, a school, an observatoiy, and a pretty valley called Annandale, whose beauty owes something to the taste of a late resident ; fancy fairs and races are held, and contribute to the embelsishment of existence. As Simla and the neigh bouring hsils are the property of certain smasi chieftains,"], [271, "247 ROAD TO SIMLA. who reside in small townships, a positical agent is stationed at the former place to regulate the respective responsibilities, and do the honours in behalf of the British government. The people of the hsils are poor, simple and tractable, subsist ing entirely by the produce of their lands. They are Hin doos, and 400,000 in number. Though polygamy prevasis hi some parts, polyandry is a more common institution, for the insufficiency of the products of the soil renders it advisable to check the increase of the human race. It is by no means uncommon for one woman to reside in the same house with four or five men, and to fulfil the duties of a wife towards all. The women are good-looking and strong ; they wear a slight cloth covering for the head, not concealing the face as in the plains, a chemise of coarse cloth, and trousers. The commercial products of these hsils are hon, wax, honey, borax, musk, wool, ginger, and opium. The fruits are apricots, walnuts, strawberries, raspberries, quinces, greengages, red and black currants, rhubarb, wheat, grain, barley, rice, <fcc. ; and in the kitchen garden may be found peas, beans, potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, parsnips, &c. Access to Simla from the plains is very easy. A palan keen dawk from the stations of Loodianah or Umballa, brings the traveller to Bhar, at the foot of the hills, which is distant about thirty nisies from Simla ; there are three stage bungalows situated at Chumbul, Hurreepore, and Syree, which lead to Simla. The ascent from Bhar to the first of these stages is considerable ; the road winds up the face of an immense mountain, and brings the travesier to the summit, where he finds the first bungalow. From Chumbul to the Khutwar river, the descent is steep but not dangerous ; the course of the traveller is for some miles along its banks through a well-cultivated valley, when by a sharp turn of the road he is suddenly brought to a chasm, flanked by perpendicular rocks about 800 or 1,000 feet in height, through which the river Gumber rolls. Passing through this gap along the banks of the Gumber, the tra vesier at length advances half a mile up a gentle ascent to the Hurreepore bungalow, and thence continuing gradually the ascent by a barren but good road, he reaches Syree, whence he proceeds to Simla. The roads are excesient and well fenced in."], [272, "248 HURDWAR. Previous to ascending the hsils, the traveller, as is usual, deposits his carriage, palankeen, or tent, <kc. <tc, in godowns belonging to a Simla firm at Bhar, and proceeds upwards with such articles of furniture only as are absolutely neces sary. The usual mode of travelling is by \" jamptiun*\" \u2014 a conveyance not unlike a large clumsy chair, having a top from -which curtains are suspended. They are carried by four( men by means of poles fixed to the sides, and are suppiWd hy the agents of the firm, together with bearers and porters. At about one-third the ascent we reach Subatoo, a toler ably extensive piece of level land, where the head-quarters of the Nusseree battalion of Goorka sepoys are situated. Immediately above Dehra, on a ridge of the outer Hima laya, stands the cantonment, or depot, of Landour. It was established in 1827, as a sanatarium for European troops, and the consequences have been most beneficial. Sick officers and soldiers sent there are speedsiy renovated, the climate in the winter and the hot months being remarkably salu brious. Near Landour is Mussooree, another elevated spot, studded with bungalows, and all appsiances of comfort. Many of the officers stationed in the upper provinces resort to it in the warm weather. Hurdwar. \u2014 975 miles from Calcutta, due south of Deyra, on the western bank of the Ganges, and a little below the spot where, receiving tribute from another stream, it enters upon the level of Hindostan, lies Hurdwar, a place of great sanctity, whither Hindoo pilgrims resort in prodigious num bers. During the first fortnight in April of each year, a fair is held which attracts many thousands of people, who contrive to render their visit subservient, at one and the same time, to business and to devotion. Above Hurdwar is Khunkbul, a teerut, or place of Hindoo pilgrimage. The town consists of a very handsome principal street, running north and south, parasiel with the sourse of the river, and is composed of a number of magnificent houses (for Hindoos) belonging to rich Brahmins and merchants from all parts of India. To have a house at Khunkhul, is at once a mark of the proprietor's piety and wealth, or importance. Most of them are bruit of brick and mortar, and the road front is"], [273, "249 KHUNKHUL. generally painted hi the pure Hindostanee taste. Many, if not asi of the householders, rent out their lower apartments to dirty bunnias, or still filthier hulwaees, or confectioners, who project numerous grass roofs or choppers, which seem to have been attacked by the white ants, and to require, if not renewal, at least a fresh coating. Crowds of mon keys (who very soon find out a city, where they are adored) crowd all parts of the houses, playing the most diverting tricks ; the females hopping about with their young ones clinging firmly to their backs, and occasionally descending with a pounce to snatch either grain or sweet meats from the shops. To accommodate the immense number of psigrims who visit Khunkhul, there are long, low, brick-and-mortar serais, busit in a uniforni manner, in which, in one promiscuous herd, are lodged wives, bullocks, husbands, cows, calves (come to be blessed), donkeys, boys, mules, camels, and tattoos (smasi ponies). The road to Khunkhul made by our government, runs direct to Hurdwar. On each side of it, for a couple of msies, are pitched the large and comfortable tents belonging to the military and civsi officers who visit the fair, either on duty, to purchase horses for the Honourable Company's Service, or to pass a week in the enjoyments of this celebrated fair. Rich natives, also, have their country-seats amongst the large mango groves, with their httle jungly gardens fisied with marigolds, tulsa, cocks' -combs, and sunflowers. The view from Khunkhul, from any of the tops of the low hsils on its west, is strikingly beautiful ; the muddy streets and the filthy natives being out of sight. Hurdwar is busit in a nearly similar manner, but is apparently older, and certainly even dirtier than Khunkhul. It sies close on the western bank of the Ganges, and many of the finest houses have their foundations in the bed of the sacred waters. They are generally of brick, but many have their lower stories of very fine white freestone. The bed of the river is here also intersected with low woody islands, and is a full mile broad in the rainy season. On the west bank are hsils 600 feet high, covered with thick brushwood and low trees. The sides of these hills are divided with rugged ravines, which afford ample cover to the leopards, or tigers, or wolves,"], [274, "250 THE HURDWAR FAIR. who descend at night to inspect tho gram-fed sheep or lambs of the English visitors. Limestone of a good quality is found in the bed of the river, both here and at Khunkhul, and is manufactured at a moderate price. The principal bathing-ghaut is at once elegant and com modious ; and the horrid waste of human life which had M often occurred by the sudden rush of the devotees through the old and narrow ghaut to reach the water at the propi tious minute, often at midnight, is, it is to be hopi ; ever prevented. From Hurdwar towards Khunkhul, and thence to Hurd war, for a mile on each side, with an average breadth of 400 yards, is occupied during the fair, with perhaps 10,000 horses, and nearly half a msilion of people. The scene is in the highest degree interesting and diverting. The horse-merchants from Bokhara and Cabool occupy the stony central parts of the dry bed of the river, with their powerful and handsome, but generally old and bien horses; while those from Toorkistan squat in the smasi compounds behind the houses of Hurdwar, separated from each other by dry stone walls. These men bring what are well known in India by their great power, and are chiefly galloways and ponies, called toorkies ; their prices vary from 250 to as high as 800 rupees, according to their shapes, colours, and paces. They have all been previously taught to amble, a pace thoroughly unpleasant to most Engsishmen, but desightful to asi black men. The elephant-dealers incline to Khunkhul for the sake of fodder, but traverse the roads of the fair with their animals during the mornings and evenings, with large bells attached to their necks, to give warning to passengers, and for the better alarming of horses. The huneeas, hulwaees,* cloth, toy, and shawl merchants, occupy the road-side close to the town, and have low cotton tents with two poles, and of a roof shape. Every here and there are large heaps of l and wheat-straw, or bhoosa (troddur), surrounded by dead thorn hedges, on sale, for the bullocks of travellers. On the sides of the hill to the west are thousands of Seik * ffulwah is the general term for sweetmeats, hut there is one species of firm thick jelly sold in earthen basins, which especially beara the name, and i_3 very delicious."], [275, "251 THE HURDWAR FAIR. fansilies, with then- huts, tents, camels, busiocks, mules, and horses, all pell-mell in the most astonishing confusion. The Seik women are awfusiy ugly, of dark-brown com plexions, and wear their hair formed back into a conical shape, over which, when abroad, they throw their bhee, or white chaddurs, which give them a very picturesque and not ungraceful air. The men are hideous, and wear ear-rings. The Seiks bring only a few barren mares and mules. The pious rajah (who first of all bargains for his absolution from some holy Brahmin), with his large train of vagabonds, and their tag-rag and bob-tasi assortment of animals, has generasiy a couple of tents, one for a dormitory, and the other for sitting under during the heat of the day ; and also a sort of awning, supported by four poles, the fringes of both being tastefully ornamented with red khurwa, stars, crosses, and peacocks, enclosed within a compound of 100 yards square. Amongst the horse-dealers some capitalists have a few select Persian horses, which they keep warmly clothed in a most handsome manner under spacious tents, which, on inquiry, wsil be found valued at from 5,000 to 50,000 rupees ; but which are, if sold at all, sold for 800 to 1,000 rupees. The greatest attention is paid by a native horse-dealer iu fattening his horse, till he resembles a stall-fed bullock, which is accomplished by cramming him with cordial stimu lants, such as pounded ginger and sugar, or cardamums and treacle, with his boiled vetches ; a man stands on each side of the horse stuffing large balls of the composition down his throat. Huge masses of assaf\u0153tida in bags, from the mountains beyond Cabool ; tons of raisins of various sorts ; almonds, pistachio-nuts ; sheep, with four or five horns ; Balkh cats, with long silken hair of singular beauty ; faqueers begging, and abusing the uncharitable with the grossest and most filthy language ; long strings of elderly ladies proceeding in a chant to the priests of the Lingum to bargain for bodsiy issue ; ghaut priests presenting their books for the presents and signatures of the European visitors ; groups of Hindoos surrounding a Brahmin, who gives each of them a certificate of his having performed the pilgrimage, \u2014 fill up various spots, and infuse sivesiness and spirit into the scene."], [276, "252 HAN si The natives who supply the horse-dealers with grass (half of which is dried up, and half green), are a race of sp hsil people, who call themselves Brahmins and Chu They are strikingly unlike the dwellers in the plains, being generally broad and lean, low and muscular. In personal habits they are amazingly filthy. In sumnn winter they wear a coarse blanket frock, which, however incredible it may appear, is never removed from their skins. But even out of this evil springs good, for this is the founda tion of their personal chronology ; they do not say, I am twenty or thirty years old, but, I have worn so many jackets ! It is strictly true that the jackets are allowed to drop off from filth and rottenness. Han si. \u2014 Returning to Seharunpore, a few msies v. i Hurdwar, and proceeding thence south-westerly, vid Kur naul, we come, at the distance of 120 miles, to Hansi, once a place of some importance. It is not a veiy regularly built town ; the principal street leading from the gate opposite the smasi lake to the esplanade of the fort is wide, and is intersected by another at right angles, which forms the Chouk. The by-lanes are crooked and numerous ; dusty in dry weather, and ankle deep after a heavy shower of rain. The population of the town is said to be 4,000 of all castes, Mahomedans and Hindoos, residing in houses of both brick and mud. It is surrounded by a brick wall, but of no stability, the ends of which terminate on the fort ditch Hansi is of some antiquity ; it was founded by Rajah Pethora of Delhi, and was captured by Mahomed of Ghi-zni, in the year 1035, 819 years ago. In recent days the cele brated adventurer George Thomas made it the capital of his short-lived independent state. The fort is an oblong, but ssightly departing from the quadrangle, and is protected by a lower fort, or fausse braye, and a deep ditch, which can eassiy be fsiled by turning the canal into it. On the side next the town the glacis is short ; but on other sides it is more prolonged. The entrance is from the town side, and is covered by bastions ; at each corner of the fausse braye, also, there are bastions enfilading the ditch. The parapet of the upper fort is low, and the guns are fired en barbette. Supposing the fort in a state of siege, or blockade, the garrison would have had one wesi to depend on for water ;"], [277, "MH0W AND INDORE. 253 this is situated within the fausse braye, near the gate, and is about 120 feet deep. There are two wells in the upper fort, but one of them is dry, and the other turned out bad, the water being brackish. In the centre of the fort is a cistern for receiving rain-water, that could be filled from below ; it is tsied over, and is about forty feet long by thirty feet broad, and is more than twenty-five deep, so that it would contain a pretty good supply, about 184,000 gallons; there is now six feet of water in the cistern, or about 44,000 gallons. The cantonment is to the south of the fort, and contains sines for the Hurriana Light Infantry, and the 1st Local Horse. Through most of the streets run channels from the canal for supplying water to the bungalows, as it is too expensive to sink wells, from the depth of sosi to be cut through ere the springs rise. Hansi used to be an extremely healthy station. Until we reach the Punjaub, there are no stations of any consequence north of Hansi. Westward and southward he the \" Great Sandy Desert,\" the Little Desert, the countries of Marwar (the chief town of which province is Jhodpore), Mewar (of which Oodipore is the principal town), the Gwalior State, already spoken of, and Central India. Of Malwa, the chief province is Mhow \u2014 (1,290 miles from Calcutta), the principal msiitary station, where a considerable body of troops is always to be found, commanded by a general officer. To compress within the narrow compass of this work even a faint outline of Central India were impossible. We refer the reader, therefore, to Sir John Malcolm's interesting work upon a country so rich in resources,* the scene of so much strife and positical intrigue, and the theatre of British triumphs over its most gallant foe. Indore \u2014 the seat of the positical agency, lies a few msies north of Mhow. This place, the capital of the Holkar Mahrattas, is large and populous, but contains no buildings of any note. Taking an easterly direction through the territories of the Dewas chief, Scindia and the Bhopal Nawaub, we reach Ashta (a large town and fort on the right * The poppy is extensively cultivated in Malwa. The opium thence extracted is manufactured and sold under excise licences, which are a large source of revenue to the government."], [278, "254 DACCA. bank of the Tarbuttee river), whence we ini passing across the territories of the Bhopal Na arrive at Behore. Between this place and Saugou \u2014 (806 msies from Calcutta), where a Bi commissioner resides, supported by troops and a strong pohce force, organized to check freebooters and enforce the payment of revenue and tribute by the petty and turbulent chiefs, the distance is 135 miles. The face of the country is an alternation of rocky hill, deep jungle, nullah cultivated country. Saugor is a desirable station for military men and young civilians, as, indeed, are most of the ] in our occupation in the neighbourhood of the Nerbudda. The sports of tiger-hunting and fishing are enjoyed in great perfection there, and the number of persons congregated at Saugor afford opportunities for the various pastimes and pleasant social reunions common to civilized life. From Saugor to the cantonment of Mirzapore, norl is 285 miles, through the various native territories of Dum mow, Punnah, the rich valley of Bundlecund, Ooncheria, Sohawul, and Rewah \u2014 territories which were, untsi t> years since, the scenes of much discord, casiing for the armed interference of the .British Government, and an alteration fa some of our political relations with the chieftains. Dawk travelsing along this tract of country is not difficult in times of peace and during the prevalence of good order ; but marching is rendered disagreeable by the character of the roads, of which no native governments take sufficient and by the occasional scarcity of water and the necessaries of (sepoy) life. At Mirzapore we have got back upon the route ad to describe the Upper Provinces, north-west of Calcutta We must now glance at the provinces and stations due east, west, and south of the Presidency. The most important place to the north-east is Dacca, a town 186 msies from Calcutta Dacca is both a civil and a military station, and many indigo-planters sikewise reside there, or in the neighbourhood. The city, with its minarets and spacious busidings, appears, during the season of inundation, hke that of Venice in the West, to rise from the surface of the water, and, like the generality of native towns, presents an irregular appearance."], [279, "DACCA. 255 The works and places of public utility, public busidings, institutions, and establishments, in the city and suburbs, consist of thannahs or police stations ; bridges across the Dasiye creek, and its branch, whkh intersects the town ; ghauts or landing places ; ferry stations ; bazaars, in which the common articles of food are sold daily ; endaras or wesis ; the Magistrate's Cutcherry ; the Judge's ditto ; Collector's ditto ; Revenue Commissioner's ditto ; Moonsiff's ditto ; Post-office (hence branch mails are sent to Calcutta, to Chit tagong, Arracan ; Mymunsing, Jumalpore, and Assam ; Sylhet,Cherra Poonjee, and to Buirisaul); the Cotwallee ; the Jasi ; Jail Hospital ; Lunatic Asylum ; Native Hospital ; Vaccine Establishment ; Charitable Fund ; St. Thomas's Church ; Baptist Mission Meeting House ; Roman Cathohc Church ; Armenian Church ; Greek Church ; one hundred and nineteen Hindoo places of worship ; Government School; Baptist Mission Schools ; Hindoo and Mahomedan Schools ; one hundred and eighty Mahomedan places of worship ; Commissariat Department ; Engsish, Armenian, and Greek Cemeteries ; Executive officer's Estabsishment ; Commissariat Office ; Military Orphan Station Committee ; Cantonment ; Elephant Depot. Within an enclosure 200 yards square, and called the Chowra, are congregated the majority of the trades of Dacca ; and innumerable petty shop-keepers here dispose of their caps, cotton and chintz dresses, hardware, fish-hooks, betel nut crackers, looking glasses, seetul pattee, or cool mats for sleeping on, cane petarrahs for travesiers, shoes of an infinite variety of patterns, cocoa-nuts prepared for hookahs, and the usual <fec. <fec. The principal part of tbe commerce of Dacca is confined to this square, which is perfectly surrounded by shops, and to the roads leading from it towards the southern parts of the town, occupied by the military and civsiians ; a compa ratively small space, running from the river backwards, not more than 350 yards. Such is the extreme unhealthiness of the cantonments, that fever is an almost certain consequence of a residence within its boundaries ; and hence officers attached to the corps on duty at Dacca, are permitted to live within the city. The houses of the Europeans were principasiy, if not"], [280, "256 DACCA. wholly, busit while Dacca contained the celebrated muslin factory ; and although large, commodious, and upper roomed, can only command a rent of from sixty to 135 rupees per mansion. Pretty little gardens are attached to most of them, and such as face the river Booree are certainly most desirable and pleasant residences. There is an Armenian church at Dacca. The floor of the interior of the busiding is divided into three parts : one inclosed by a railing, for the altar ; a central portion, intu which two folding-doors open ; and another railed off, whieh is exclusively occupied by the women and chsidren, has a gallery over it. The altar stands in a semicircle, about four feet distant from the wall, aud is raised, to the height of about ten feet, by steps. These steps sustain twenty-four wax candles, each three feet long, and also a number of small crosses, of some gilt or shining metaL The floor of the verandah contains many tombstones, in memory of departed Armenian Christians, who formerly abounded in the city of Dacca, where they are still an influential and wealthy body. Within fifteen feet of the church, but quite separated, stands a coarse square tower, having four spiracles at its summit. At the base, within the square of the four walls, a few feet from the ground, a marble tablet has been placed in the wall, with an inscrip tion, both in the Armenian and English languages, signifying that this superb and magnificent steeph was dedicated to the honour and glory of God, &c. Within the military cantonments are several very hand some upper and lower-roomed spacious houses, for which no tenants can be found. Dacca was formerly a place of great importance, but it has seriously diminished since the loss of the muslin trade, which has almost entirely disappeared. It is true that, by giving a commission, an extremely delicate article may still be procured, at the rate of 150 rupees, or 151. for ten yards ; but at that rate, as may be readsiy imagined, little can be sold, as the demand must be necessarily very small. The working of shawl-scarfs with flossed silk is carried to great perfection at Dacca, and many are despatched by banghy to Calcutta. Beautiful ear-rings and other orna ments, made of the purest ssiver, and of an infinite variety"], [281, "257 DACCA MANUFACTURES. of patterns, can be suppsied at a very short notice, and at reasonable prices. The suburbs of Dacca were formerly inhabited by thou sands of famisies of muslin- weavers, who, from the extreme desicacy of their manufacture, were obsiged to work in pits, sheltered from the heat of the sun and changes of the weather ; and even . after that precaution, only while the dew lay on the ground, as the increasing heat destroyed the extremely delicate thread. When the manufacture ceased, these pits were wholly deserted, and they are now filled with rain after every shower, which speedsiy becomes putrid, and favours the production of the rankest, vegetation. The city contains a few rich and respectable indigo planters, who, in addition to that manufacture, speculate in government lands, which they rent out to zemindars and ryots. A considerable time has elapsed since they intro duced the coffee-plant ; but they meet with innumerable difficulties and unforeseen obstacles in its culture, finding it almost impossible, by any arts of persuasion, to induce the natives to pay it the requisite attention in weeding, so as to make it a jmying crop. There is no fault in the soil or climate, for the plant bears very abundantly, and the berry is of fair quality. The betel nut-trees produce very heavy crops, and they form one of the staples of the country. Many of the areas attached to native houses near the city may he seen almost choked with them. The slender elegance of the tree com mands admiration. Dacca has now but three manufactures worthy of the name, but they are very curious ones. The most important is that of violins. Great numbers are made, and sold at the low rate of two rupees, or four shillings sterling ! Few manjees, or steersmen of boats, leave the city without pur chasing some, either on speculation or for their own private enjoyment during their tedious voyages. The sounds of the violin may be heard at all hours of the day and night. The Bengalees are, in fact, a highly musical people, as any one may discover by frequenting the streets of Dacca during the night ; when, if you peep into a shop where an industrious mechanic is following his trade, you will most probably find another recreating himself, after his daily labour, either with s"], [282, "258 SYLHET. a viosin or a sarwegee, and occasionally singing to his own music, but never English airs. Groups may be also seen walking along, and singing to the utmost pitch of their voices. The second manufacture consists in the formation of bracelets, of different diameters, both for children and women; being sections of a sea-shell, \u25a0 called \" sunk,\" evi dently because they are found under water ! Necklaces, called krantas, are also formed of the thick part of tho same shesi, enough to furnish almost the whole of the Bengal army. The former are cut by a halfmoon-shapetl about three feet long, worked by the right band, having a moveable edge, which is replaced when destroyed by long use. The shells are a species of univalve, strongly resembling, if not, the Mwrcux tulipa, procured from Calcutta, where they are purchased at the cheap rate of two and a half annas per hundred. They are from four to seven inches long, vary in diameter from two inches to two inches and a half thick, are very heavy, and in whiteness far exceed ivory. More than 300 mechanics are constantly employed in this curious manufacture. The tribe occupy a whole street of the most picturesque and ancient houses in Dacca, running behii Kotwallee, towards the area formerly the site of the Honourable Company's Presidency. The single houses in this street vary from ten to fifteen feet in breadth, and are from two to three stories. The narrow ones appear as if built of cards, and all are curiously decorated with Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian pilasters, supporting nothing, and such-like heathenish devices. The third manufacture, in a mercantile point of view is hardly worthy of record ; it is merely that of idols ! They are made of a certain black stone, not qmte three feet long, and very nicely posished. Aster receiving consecration from some priestly Brahmin, they are set up for public worship; as a rival to the living God. So accustomed are Engli .-i to see such objects of worship, that they hardly ever elicit a remark. From Dacca there is a post-road to Sylhet (325 msies from Calcutta), on the borders of Assam, where a positical officer, supported by a couple of regiments, resides, for the conduct of the relations with the Munniporeans and other neighbouring chiefs. Due"], [283, "THE C0SSYAH HILLS. 259 east of Sylhet are Cachar and Munnipore, states taken under British protection during the Burmese war, the former now constituting part of our possessions, and the latter in close and friendly alliance with our government. Above Sylhet rise the Cossyah Hsils, the chief station in which, Cherrapoonjee,* has become a sanatorium for sick people from Calcutta. COSSYAH HILLS AM) CHERRA POONJEE. The Cossyah Hsils embrace all that tract of country which reaches from Assam to Sylhet, and from Mymunsing to Cachar. At first sight they appear to lie east and west, and exhibit various degrees of undulation in the most pleasing irregu larity, and, whether viewed collectively as a finished prospect, or each particular feature examined separately, the whole is interesting to an extent more easy to feel than to describe. Especiasiy after a considerable fall of rain on the summits, when the verdure becomes more rich, and numerous cata racts are formed at various points, the beholder is at once presented with a landscape combining everything that is subsime, every section replete with variety, and eveiy particular spot prominently beauteous. The table-land commences apparently from a line drawn horizontally midway up the hsils, along which are distin guishable some bold precipices, one of which measures 600 feet in height, and is situated between the road to Cherra Poonjee from Therria ghaut and Byrong. The only peaked hsil in the Cossyah range is the granite mountain near Noongkhlao ; its height is 1,200 feet, and the ascent to it is both difficult and accompanied with risk, which may be avoided by prudence and care. The elevation of the station of Cherra is 4,200 feet, and that of the village of Cherra Poonjee 4,500. Towards the north of the hsils, the elevation is greater than any other side, and there are deep vasieys on the east and west. * Cherrapoonjee contains a coal-mine, yielding coal superior to that of Burdwan in quality. s 2"], [284, "260 THE HILL TRIBES. Climate. \u2014 The situation of these lulls is the nearest from Bengal, except Dorjesing, and their csimate is compai that of England, being quite as salubrious ami invigorating; especiasiy from October to the commencement of the rains it is very delightful. The temperature of Cherra is about fourteen degrees lower than that of the plains at corresponding periods ; and there is no higher ground between Cherra and the plains of Sylhet. \" There are frequent showers and fogs at all seasons of the year, and the periodical rains, wdiich commence early and terminate late, are excessively heavy. The annual fall of rain is computed at the immense quantity of 300 inches ; and upwards of 1 00 inches have been measured in six weeks. The occurrence of very severe thunder-storms, which are often accompanied with destructive hasi-showers, is frequent. Routes and Approaches. \u2014 A person may at any time reach this sanatarium in six days, if not less, if he choose to travel by dawk, when he would have to pass Jessore, Furreedpore, and Dacca, three civil stations, where he could not only refresh, but also, if necessary, avasi himself of medical aid. The other mode of performing the journey is by water, through the Soonderbunds, which ought not on any account to occupy more than twenty-four days. The inhabitants of these regions are remarkable for their love of independence, and differ strikingly from Bengalees. The nation commonly known under the term \" Khasia\" may be said to be divided into the Khasias, the Garrows, Hajoongs, Kokees, Kacharrees, and a race of people remark ably ferocious, not scrupling to feed on human flesh. Besides these tribes, there is a remarkably savage race who inhabit a very considerable tract of country between the Cossyahs and the Hajoongs, and maintain an exterminating hostility amongst themselves. The people in general are Hindoos ; and asi are pagans of some denomination. The constitution of the government of the different tribes may be said to consist of democracy and osigarchy, whsist some of them acknowledge subjection to one individual, termed a Rajah. Their resigious affairs are administered by a certain order of priesthood of simited influence, though greater respect is attached to this functionary, in consequence"], [285, "261 DORJELING. of the excessive superstition of the people, than to the indi vidual who presides over their civil and misitary institutions, known by the name of Noongskar. The sine of succession is not only confined to the male, but it is simited also to the female part of the famsiy. The commerce and manufactures of the Cossyah Hills are of small importance. Cloth of a good texture, though rather coarse, and indigo, obtained from a plant not at all resembling the sort cultivated in other parts of India, but of a good quasi ty, compose the principal manufactures. The exports are ivory, cotton, beeswax, cotton cloth, honey, and chilsies ; and the imports consist of coral beads, tobacco, salt, brass pots and pans, daws, and a few other articles. There are several quarries of limestone in Hammameea, from which lime is obtained for purposes of building ; and extensive forests of fir-trees. Numberless sheets of water appear everywhere, and each of them larger as they extend towards the south-eastern simits. Close to the mausoleum of Shah Jalalaadeen, at Sylhet, is a beautiful spring of water, which, being the only good water in that district, is in requisition by European residents and others. A more popular, because a more contiguous sanatorium for the people of Calcutta, is Dorjeling, in the same direction. Dorjeling is situated on one of the numerous ramifica tions of the Sinchul Mountains, which, rising nearly 9,000 feet, form so remarkable a feature in every view of the Sikim Hills, from the plains. This ramification takes a northern direction ; and after descending about two or three msies, rises again into a smasi spreading eminence, whence a second ramification of some breadth is thrown off to the westward. This spot is the site of the village or town of Dorjesing. It is in latitude 27\u00b0 N, and longitude nearly the same as Calcutta, and is situated on the southern side of a great hollow or basin, being that of the Runjeet river, which fasis into the Teesta a few miles east of the place ; to the north the view is open, and exhibits the usual succession of range beyond range, all irregularly ramifying in every direction, and in apparently inextricable confusion. It terminates in the Snowy range. To the westward the view is confined by"], [286, "262 DORJELING. a lofty range at the distance of about ten miles ; to the east ward appears the vasiey of the Teesta, and on each side of it is the same confused assemblage of mountain-ridges as to the north and to the south. The elevation of the station of Dorjeling is 6,957 feet The country, in respect to natural scenery, is equal to Lan dour and Mussooree ; the oaks and rhododendra of greater variety and larger size. The productions are, oaks, chestnut, birch, maple, sal, sissoo, toon, mango, rhododendron, champ, magnolia, lotus-tree, sycamore, holly, osive, semul, and fig. Dorjeling commands, probably, one of the most magnificent prospects of the Snowy range visible anywhere ; in which appears eminently conspicuous the peak Kunching J inga, said to be 27,000 feet above the sea, and supposed by some to be a volcano. On the mountains to the northward of the place, there had formerly been much cultivation, and on the lower part, the forest chiefly confines itself to the deep dells and ravines; but the Lepchas rarely continue to cultivate the sann more than three years, and the vegetation on the lower situ ations is so very luxuriant, that on their abandoning a spot, it is speedily covered again with jungle. Dorjeling is about 98 hours' dawk-travelling from Calcutta; and horses, palankeen carriages, aud buggies are on hire on the whole line. Water-carriage from June to September, to a distance of only thirty miles from the foot of the hills, and during the remainder of the year Dulolgunge on the Maha nuddee, about sixty miles from the foot of the hills, is the place where boats are obliged to stop. From thence land carriage is easy. From all stations below Allahabad, Dorjeling wsil be pre ferred to the sanatoria in the north-western mountains, the distance of Allahabad being in a direct sine from Dorjeling and Dehra, as nearly as possible equal, and about four hundred msies. Even from Allahabad, the invalid's preferable course is to Dorjesing ; for this simple reason, that he has the advan tage of water-carriage as far as Malda, with the stream; and for this same reason even to stations above Allahabad, it might admit of question whether the western or eastern station of health be the preferable. It is true, that as the invalid has also to return, it may be said he will in either case have"], [287, "263 TEMPERATURE OF DORJELING. the stream in his favour once, and only once ; but to the invasid it is often, perhaps always, of more consequence to reach his destination quickly, than to return, he having it always in his power to choose his time for the latter. The lines of approach to Dorjeling by land, from the different parts of the country, are vid Rungpore from the south-eastern part of Bengal, from the south vid Dinage pore, and from the westward vid Purneah and Kissengunge. By water, the route is from the Ganges, up the Mahanuddee river as far as navigable, and from the spot thus attained, the remainder of the journey must be performed by land. All these routes unite at Titalya, and there are good and practicable roads for travellers to all those places ; namely, Rungpore, Dinagepore, and Purneah ; and from the latter a tolerable one to Kissengunge. From Rungpore there is an excellent road to Titalya, kept in good order ; from Kissen gunge to Titalya there is another road ; from Dinagepore, which is the most direct line from Calcutta, there is an excesient road ; and from Dinagepore to Bargatchy, on the left bank of the Ganges, opposite to Bogwonjolee, the same road is continued, equasiy well constructed. The road from Calcuttta to Bogwonjolee passes through Dum-Dum, Barraset, Kishnaghur, and Berhampore; and this is in fact the old misitary road reopened. A place situated like Dorjeling, at an elevation which secures it the temperature of a high latitude, yet within the fusi influence of the tropical rains, may well be supposed to possess a peculiar character of climate. Such is the case ; for although at the great height of nearly 7,000 feet above the sea, yet, owing to its nearness to the tropics, the winter is not to be compared for cold to that of England ; whsie from the fall of rain at that season the summer is much colder. Its mean temperature is thus produced, which is about, or but httle exceeds, that of England, or of the north of France. It has been ascertained, in India at least, that as we ascend in elevation, the temperature falls at the rate of about 1\u00b0 for every 300 feet. The mean temperature of Dorjeling below that of Calcutta may therefore be confidently reckoned at 24\"; it might indeed be even lower, on account of its having a northern aspect, and having a higher latitude by 5\u00b0. The fosiowing table shows that, of the several sanatoria,"], [288, "264 CLIMATE OF DOHJELINC. Simla is the only one which has the advantage of a superior elevation, and this but of 268 feet, scarcely amounting to a single degree of temperature. As to the higher latitude of those stations, the difference is only 3\u00b0 ; and it is pr more than counterbalanced by the northern aspect, v wanting at Simla and Landour, or Mussooree. In short, asi without exception who have visited Dorjeling agree in this at least, that it is scarcely possible to speak too favourably of the climate. Seasons. \u2014 With this tropical situation, the seasons follow the course of those of the plains ; of spring there is none, about the vernal equinox a few showers of rain fall, with sometimes a httle hail. They are often repeated during tho months of April and May, gradually becoming heavier aud more frequent, till the setting in of the rains, at the begin ning of June. But these \"-spring sltowers\" are not foi by the immediate effects of those of a higher latitude. There, herbs and flowers come forth at the first call of spring, and a few months (hi some latitudes a few weeks) see the plains of ripening corn in the place of the plains of snow ; while here, though vegetation takes a start, its progress is at first but slow : the brown left by the recent frosts hardly disap pears till the rains have fairly begun. The signs of summer are but httle, if any more, marked than those of s] The rains cease about the end of September and beginning of October, and almost immediately afterwards the frosts begin. Thus there are but two seasons at Dorjeling, \u2014 the winter, and the rains. The rains set in fairly at the beginning of June. The weather becomes cloudy, and the rain falls steadsiy ; not very heavy, and, unless in much-exposed situations, straight down and even, there being httle wind. Two inches in the twenty four hours often fasi ; sometimes three ; and, though more rarely, sometimes four. Notwithstanding this, the weather during the rains is not unpleasant to those who have, or make for themselves, occupation within doors. The rains continue unabated during the months of June, July, and August, about thirty inches on an average fasiing in each of those months ; with September a decided change takes place : the continued fasi changes into showers, which become less and less frequent, whsie the sun shows itself oftener, and its"], [289, "CLIMATE OF DORJELING, 265 gleams are of longer duration, till towards the latter end of the month, or the beginning of October, when the rains cease altogether. During the rains the thermometer ranges from about 54\u00b0 to 74\u00b0, rarely above or below either : of course it feels cool and pleasant, though the occasional sunshine is now and then very hot. As might be expected, the damp is very great, not so much so, perhaps, as in the plains ; but, being colder, the air is not so soon dried in the intervals of the rain, and it is more felt. The cold weather is divided into three portions. The first, at the conclusion of the rains, is mild and pleasant, the atmo sphere tolerably clear, the ground covered with flowers and sweet-scented herbs, and the prospect, for the most part, clear and open : this is the autumn, if autumn there be at Dorje ling. In November the hoar frost begins, and the cold weather comes on at the latter part of the month. The ground is frozen in December and January, sometimes almost asi day ; the weather feels very cold, the atmosphere is cloudless, dry, and sparksing, giving a sensation like that felt on a frosty morning at home. All vegetation has now ceased, the httle grass there is, the herbs, and flowers, are frost-bitten, and dried up ; ice stands in the httle pools of water in the morning, and in shady places it lasts all day. At early morning it is very cold, but as the sun rises, it becomes agree able, and at mid-day warm, with bright sunshine ; as the evening comes on, it is cold and chilly, and night is clear and starlight. About Christmas the weather is cloudy, as in the plains at that time, and rain sometimes falls. The mean temperature between the highest and lowest for the whole year is 54\u00b0 06', which is somewhat about that of England. The winds at Dorjeling are, for the most part, sight and variable, with a general direction from the west. They are never high, except in very exposed situations, and there amounting only to a strong breeze. This, as wesi as the general freedom from thunder-storms, is owing to the situa tion of the station, on a promontory, or long hill-ridge projecting into a basin, surrounded by higher mountains. Thunder is frequently heard, but not near."], [290, "266 DISEASES OF DORJELING. Geological Fornuitions. \u2014 The geological structure of this country has, no doubt, its effect upon the temperature, and indeed upon the wholesomeness of the climate. The whole formation being primitive rocks, the evaporation from the surface is great, and constantly going on, while the vegetable mould and surface soil are very thin. Another source of cold remains to be noticed in the won derful forests which clothe the whole face of the country. On whichever side we turn, the whole road from Punkabarree, upwards of thirty miles, runs through a forest of the noblest trees, with an almost impenetrable underwood for the entire way ; and the same extends over the whole of Sikim to the Snowy Mountains. To be sure, here and there, a Lepcha clearing, and now and then a mountain-slip, on the top of a hsil cleared by fire or other accident, is free from trees ; but they are hardly distinguishable, unless upon the very spot. Now, where there is vegetation like this, the ground is never dry, neither the wind nor the rays of the sun being able to penetrate to it; and where there is damp, there is cold. Those parts of the station which are cleared of trees are certainly drier, warmer, and more cheerful than where the jungle is still uncut. The diseases of Dorjeling are, affections of tlie apparently caused by the heat of the sun. Bowel complti iids, wliich have been frequent, chiefly diarrh\u0153a, but some of dysentery. They are to be attributed to bad food, indifferent lodging, and scanty clothing, and not to the chmate. They have occurred almost entirely among the poorer classes. Fevers at Dorjeling, as in most other places, form the great bulk of Indian diseases. They are believed to be chiefly contracted below, though in some cases it is difficult to come to that conclusion. Natives proceeding from the plains in the rainy season are often, perhaps generally, attacked by fever on their arrival at Dorjesing. Hepatic affections are very rare among the natives. Disorders of the digestive organs occur in a ssight degree, not unfrequently owing to improper food ; but they have readsiy and speedsiy been cured. The worst cases, among Europeans, have been in parties coming up on that account for change of csimate ; and in the greater part of them the amendment has been wonderful."], [291, "267 DISEASES. Rheumatism is everywhere a tedious disorder, and it is not uncommon at Dorjeling. Its general duration is less than in Europe. When contracted below, it would be reheved by removal to this climate. Syphilis is as severe here as in the plains, perhaps more so, but is easily reheved by proper treatment. Bronchocele is sometimes met with, and in very bad cases. Debility, consequent upon fevers or other diseases in the plains, is also very speedily overcome. Almost immediately on arrival, a decided improvement takes place, the appetite is improved, and the strength daily increases. Sometimes these lead to excess, when a relapse occurs, or fevers (the most of which are probably contracted below) come on ; but by prudent hving, and avoidance of exposure to the weather, recovery is rapid, and lasting. The patients most sikely to derive benefit from the csiniate of Dorjeling are those suffering from debility aster fevers, or other debisitating disorders, and unattended by organic disease ; from indigestion, and its accompanying symptoms ; almost asi female complaints ; general debility without any specific cause, beyond a long residence in the heats of the plains, and local and cutaneous disorders. Organic Visceral disease is supposed to be aggravated by, or at least not to yield to, the influence of a hsil climate, so readsiy as in the plains. But the influence of the csimate on persons enjoying a moderate degree of health is quite as satisfactory as it is in cases of disease. In India there are many persons who can be called neither isi nor wesi ; who are troubled with occa sional fevers, costiveness, and other symptoms of indigestion ; who are obliged to take a good deal of care of themselves, and yet are able to pursue their ordinary avocations. Per haps almost every European in India is more or less in this condition : such on arrival at Dorjeling immediately expe riences the greatest benefit. The appetite becomes improved ; hypochondriacal symptoms disappear, and the aptitude to exercise returns with all the activity felt at home. Ladies who in the plains rose and took a constitutional drive by prescription, get up early in the morning, and take long walks ; whsie gardening, and other out-of-door work, afford agreeable employment for the day."], [292, "268 DORJELING SEASONS. Chsidren, of all others, are benefited most by a change to this climate. They are not long here, before the thin, pallid, playing-on-the-carpet, peevish child, becomes fat and n fair weather running about asi the day out of doors ; while the child who in the plains constantly suffered from bowel complaints, or remittent fever, comes to life again, regaining his health and strength, and playing about as merrily as an English child. The time for invasids going to the hsils must depend upon the nature of the complaint, and the constitution of the patient. In determining this, it must be remembered that the climate is cold and damp during the rains ; and to send some cases to it at this season, would, probably, be equally injurious as in Europe to send them to the sea-side in winter. Those who can bear, and are likely to derive benefit by the cold, should be sent in October, before the cold weather sets in, while it is stsil warm, and the atmosphere is clear and dry. This season will be found to be the very best time for going, in the great majority of cases ; especially in those who can remain, as all ought to do, for the whole year. Supplies of grain must be necessarily drawn from the plains at first, the country itself scarcely yielding enough for its own scanty population ; but this necessity need not last long, the soil being everywhere excellent, and with the extra ordinary facilities existing for irrigation, likely, with cultivation, to be highly productive. But even in drawing supplies from the plains, there is httle inconvenience, as the distance is so small to the cultivated tract at the foot of the hisis. Supplies of animal food have in like manner to be drawn from the plains at first ; but these mountains afford such advantages in this particular, that they will be soon fusiy sufficient, not only for the wants of the largest station likely to be established, but they might even supply all the European population of India ; and perhaps, in no part of the world are to be found such extensive tracts of superior pasturage, as proved by the fine condition of the cattle, not only in Sikim, but in the British mountain provinces to the north-west. A few words on Assam will complete the sketch of the south-eastern possessions and principalities. Assam. \u2014 East and east-north-east of Rungpore, a post and banghy road leads to Assam, where a commissioner, with"], [293, "269 CUTTACK. an adequate number of assistants, a large posice force, and a smasi body of troops, maintains the integrity of the British frontier in that direction. The usual mode, however, of proceeding to Assam from Bengal, is by water, as there is a free communication between the Berhampooter and the Ganges, and boats of the largest burthen easily pass from one into the other. The valley of Assam consists of a rich soil, covered with verdure and abundantly watered. Too much of the country, however, is stsil covered with jungle; and it will probably be many years before European capital and skill have cleared away the noxious vegetation and developed the wealth of the land. At present, European enterprise confines itself to the search for coal and caout chouc, which are found in great abundance, and to the cultivation of the tea-tree. The exports of the Assam Tea Company to England have already been considerable, and the quasity of the tea has been wesi spoken of by the London tea-brokers. From the east and south-east we now turn to the south west provinces of Bengal. Cuttack is the southernmost station under the Bengal pre- sidency. The road, which is a continuation of the great Benares line, leads to Pooree, the seat of the Temple of Juggernauth, and a desightful place of resort for sea-bathers from Calcutta. Cuttack, from its vicinity to the sea, and the total absence of asi vegetation, is one of the most agree- able and healthful stations in India. The society is small, consisting, as it does, ofa few civilians and a small proportion of military ; but the contiguity of Cuttack to other small stations renders a considerable reunion of visitors a matter of no great difficulty. The finest salt in India is manufac- tured on the coast of Cuttack, yielding the Government a revenue httle short of eighteen lacs of rupees, when the East-India Company possessed a monopoly of the manufac ture of that necessary of Hindoo life. The Cuttack salt, distinguished for its whiteness and purity, before it has passed into the hands of the merchant, is of the species casied pangah, procured by boiling. The process observed by the molunghees, or manufacturers, is rude and simple to the last degree. The sea-water, which is brought up by various"], [294, "270 THE TEMPLE OF JUGGERNAtTH. small channels to the neighbourhood of the manufacturing stations, or khalaries, is first mixed up and saturated with a quantity of the salt earth, or efflorescence which forms on the surface of the low ground all around, after it has been overflowed by the high tides, and which, being scraped off by the molunghees, is thrown into cylindrical receptacles of earth, having a vent underneath, and a false bottom made of twigs and straw. The strongly impregnated brine fill through the grass, &o., is carried, by a channel dug a ground, to a spot at hand, surrounded with an inolosi mats, in the centre of which a number of oblong es pots, generally about two hundred, are cemented together by mud in the form of a dome, under which is a fire-place or oven. The brine is poured into this collection of pots or choolas, and boiled until a sufficient degree of evaporation has taken place, when the salt is taken out, as it forms, with iron ladles, and collected in heaps in the open air. The heaps are afterwards thatched with reeds, and remain in this state until sold or removed by the officers of the agency. There is little trade carried on from Cuttack ; but in seasons of great scarcity, and on the occurrence of the furious gales and inundations to which the coast is peculiarly exposed, large importations of grain, rice, &e, take place. The great temple of Juggernauth, at Pooree, presents, from the sea-view, an imposing appearance : it is, on a close inspection, neither remarkable for its architecture nor the materials of which it is composed, the latter being rough stone, overlaid with a coating of coarse chunam. The Kh.k, chief tower, and other minor busidings connected with it, are comprised within a wasi surrounding a platform, raised high above the ground, and no less than 650 feet in length : the height of the tower is 200 feet. According to ancient Brahminical records preserved in the building, the Temple of Sri Jeo, or Juggernauth (some writers spell the word without the h), existed many centuries before Christ ; was destroyed and rebusit sundry times, and was lastly restored A.D. 1198, by Rajah Bhim Deo, of Orissa, who is said to have expended nearly 500,000?. on the work ! Within its holy precincts many inferior deities are provided with lodgings and atten dants ; but the most revered of the divine occupants are"], [295, "THE TEMPLE OF JUGGERNAUTH. 271 Juggernauth (the Lord of the World), an alias of the many named Vishnu, Buldeo (his brother), and their sister, the saffron-coloured Subhadra. The average number of pilgrims who annually resort to Pooree is said to be 120,000 ; many of whom are destined never to return. Thousands of these poor wretches die from famine or over-fatigue during the journey. Many of these fanatics actuasiy crawl from great distances to this, the Mecca of their hopes. Immense numbers are also destroyed by the pernicious climate of the rainy season ; and their corpses, which are thrown on the sands, near the English station, are either burnt or left to be devoured by the troops of Pariah dogs, jackals, and vultures, with which this place, so rich in food for them, swarms. It is said, that in the space of half an acre of ground, as many as 150 bodies have been seen, with twice as many of the before-mentioned scavengers fighting over their horrid feast. The grand ceremony of the instal lation of the idol on his triumphal car (which is called Rath Jatra), takes place in June. The usual influx of pilgrims at thi_. epoch is enormous ; but their numbers decrease yearly, and the sanctity of Juggernauth wanes in proportion to the progress of civilization in India. The mad fanaticism which formerly led hundreds of voluntary victims to immolate themselves beneath the wheels of the idol's car, is now much sobered down. The temple is inclosed by a high stone wall, square, about 250 yards each way ; gates are in the middle of each face, which look to the cardinal points. The eastern, or lion-door, is the principal entrance, and is guarded by two stone animals, which the most depraved imagination has denominated sions. The gateways asi rise in a pyramidal shape, with rude sculp ture and the portraiture of hideous figures. On looking through the eastern gate, the entrance for pilgrims, the only tiling to be seen is a broad flight of steps, which leads to the temple. A handsome black stone pillar, the shaft of one piece, and twenty-five feet long, stands immediately before the entrance. It is one of the most chaste and elegant pieces of art ever seen, and is said to be equal in design and pro portion to any psilar of the Corinthian order. The grand temple in which the idols are lodged is a"], [296, "272 THE IDOLS. very high tower in the middle of the square, and, as \u2022 observed, from its great elevation, it forms a conspicuous land mark to sasiors coming from different parts of the world. Its form is square for the distance of two-thirds, from whenoe it decreases by a ssight curve to the top : thus it li usual configuration of Hindoo temples ; it is also fin this part. On the top of this is a large circular, flat black stone, cut like a melon. On the summit of this stone is tbe chucker, or wheel \u2014 the distinguishing symbol of Vishnu, and precisely resembsing the wheel of a Bhip's rudder. The whole is surmounted by flags and pennons of the appropriate colours of the god in whose honour they are displayed. The modes are various by which the devotees conceive they render their piety more striking and propitiatory. The great ceremony is that of the Rath Jatra ; but a minor and prefatory ceremony is that of bathing the idols. Their godships are formed up in sine, on an elevated terrace within the inclosure, aud protected from the night dews by an extensive and gaudy canopy of many-coloured cloths. They consist of three frightful wooden faces, of the l tive colours of black, brown, and yesiow ; the lower portions of the figures being closely swathed in cloth wrappers. The fosiowing day the idols are consigned to their respec tive niches in the temple. Upon this occasion it is the annual custom for Juggernauth to declare himself to bc en petite sante\", from the effects of a severe cold, consequent, probably, upon his bath, which continues to afflict him until the day of the grand ceremony, when, by the wise treatment of his physicians, he is restored to his usual good health 1 To such a length as this is carried the blind superstition of this simple people ; and it is carefully nourished and fos tered by the crafty Brahmins, who doubtless secure to them selves a large share of the offerings paid at the shrine of the idolized but helpless King Log. At the festival of the Rath Jatra, the idols are conducted in state to visit their country seat, one mile and a half from Pooree ; a journey of three days. By asi accounts, the manner of inducting their wor ships from the temple to their raths or cars is not remarkably ceremonious. Ropes being fastened round their throats, they are dragged \" neck and heels\" down the grand steps through the mud, and are finasiy hauled by the same gasiows-like"], [297, "THE BLACK PAGODA. 273 process into their respective vehicles, where they are deco rated by the priests, and welcomed by shouts of admiration and triumph from the fanatical multitude. The raths on which the monster-deities are drawn are of lofty and massive dimensions and clumsy architecture ; that of Sri Jeo is nearly forty-five feet in height, has a platform of thirty-five feet square, and moves upon sixteen wheels of solid timber. The Black Pagoda is situate sixteen miles north of Pooree, near the village of Kanarac. It was built by Narsing Deo Langora, Rajah of Orissa, in A.D. 1241; but other writers attribute its erection to a much earsier date. In its ancient days of celebrity it was designated the Temple of the Sun, and was dedicated to his worship, under the title of Suriga, in consequence of that deity having cured the son of Vishnu of leprosy, with which he was infected as a punishment for having seen (accidentally) some young ladies of the palace (but whose palace the record saith not) during the operation of bathing. What remains of the building is the pagoda, or square building, the sides to the cardinal points ; the walls are fifty feet high, and of amazing thickness. From thence upward the roof is an exact pyramid, on the apex of which are the remains of some symbol of the god. The pyramidal part is divided into compartments, each overhanging the other, like the roof of a Chinese temple, flat and decreasing to the top. The part still most perfect is the inferior tower, and is called the Jug Mohun. The sanctuary in which the idol was lodged is almost de stroyed ; what does remain marks a freak in the operations of time, or whatever is the destroying power. The sanctuary was in the shape of a tall tower, exceeding in height the other part of the temple. From half-way down it had a slight curvature and terminated in a point. Only one quarter of this building is still ereot ; the other three are prostrate in indistinguishable ruin; it seems as if the tower had divi ded in half and then crosswise, cutting it into four pieces. When the three parts fell, it was difficult to account for the fourth retaining its perpendicular ; but the time is not far distant when it will soon follow the others, now at its feet. From the altitude of the Black Pagoda, and its contiguity to the sea, it is a conspicuous landmark for seamen, The temple is chiefly formed of a stone easily affected by T"], [298, "274 THE COLES, ETC. time and the elements ; though about the doorways there is a remarkably hard greenish stone used. The eastern, or principal, entrance has had the greatest share of ornamental labour. There is an entablature over this gateway, sculp tured in the most excesient manner, both in design and execution. Foliage is springing up in its crevices, and will soon lay its glories in the dust. A complete shrubbery has growff upon the summit of the temple, which was once graced with the Leel Chucker, or blue wheel of Vishnu. An absurd notion prevailed among the Hindoos of the temple having a loadstone on its top, which, attracting the ships passing, drew them to destruction. Some desperate foreigners, b suffered a like catastrophe, stormed the pagoda and I away the magnet. The sanctuary being thus defiled, the shrine was deserted by the Brahmins, and many of its orna ments removed to the temple of Juggernauth. In the north-west of Cuttack lie certain districts iuhabited by hsil tribes, who were in a state of revolt against the authority of the British Government so far back as 1832-33, but who are now obedient subjects. The country is termed the Colehan \u2014 the people the Coles. A political commissioner resides in the territory, and a corps of local infantry is placed at his disposal. The upper boundary of this tract of country forms the south-west frontier of the possessions surbordi nate to the Supreme Government. Beyond this point, the country is directly under the Madras authoritiea There are few other places of any moment within 300 miles of Calcutta. Rungpore, Malda, Dinagepore, Purneah, and Kishnagur, are simply civil stations \u2014 the residences of collectors, judges, &c. There are many indigo factoi their immediate neighbourhood, and at Kishnaghur art manufactories of printed muslins, and clay figures represent ing the costumes of the people. These districts swarm with game, and afford the boar and tiger-hunter abundance of sport. The indigo factory is quite peculiar to India. The excellent blue dye obtainable from the plant causes it to be very extensively cultivated in Bengal and Behar, and manu-"], [299, "275 INDIGO PLANTING. factured for the home market. The process is very simple \u2014 the sosi most favourable to the culture is one that is rich and moist. After being well tsiled and cleared of weeds, the seed, which resembles the gunpowder grain, is sown at the commencement of the rainy season ; in three or four days the plant appears above ground, in two months it is cut. The factory consists of a series of vats of brick- work and chunam ; into one of these the plant is thrown, and a suffi cient quantity of water is let in to cover it ; in a few hours fermentation commences \u2014 after a short time the liquor is drawn off into another vat, where it is strongly agitated by means of wooden implements. This is done to separate the true dye from the salt of the plant; the former is thus precipitated to the bottom of the vat, and the water being carried off, the indigo remains a short time to settle, after which it is taken out, and being drained in cloth bags, is dried gradually, in the shade, in shallow wooden boxes. Whsie yet damp it is cut into small cakes of an inch square, and when in a fit state, is packed in barrels and boxes, and transmitted to Calcutta for shipment to England. The life of the indigo planter is by no means free from anxieties. The crop is liable to a variety of contingencies before it reaches maturity. It may be washed away by premature falls of heavy rain, or inundations of the river near which it is sown. It is apt to become suddenly dry and wither away, or it may be destroyed by a peculiar species of caterpillar. Then, in the making, if the fermentation be not stopped at the precise time \u2014 or if the dye be not care fully separated from the salt of the plant, the article may be ruined. Finasiy, there are the risks attending the shipment to Calcutta, and the anxieties resulting from a fluctuating market in England. Large fortunes have been made by indigo manufacturers, and hundreds have been ruined. It is quite a lottery. THE BURMESE COAST AND TENASSERIM PROVINCES. The results of the war with the Burmese in 1824-25 placed the coast on the upper eastern side of the Bay of Ben gal entirely in our possession ; but it has not been deemed T 2"], [300, "276 BURMAH AND TENASSERIM. necessary to occupy more than four stations with troopa Communication with these stations is generally etfci rl sea, as the land route is circuitous. The latter ro Dacca, whence the traveller proceeds southerly and westerly, crossing the Megna, at Bhowanygunge, and reaching (Jhit- tagong after a journey of 144 miles and four furlongs. The road is excellent, supplies profuse, and only two nullah] intersect the way. A commissioner resides at Chiti The war of 1852-53 has given us possession of inland tracts as high up as Prome, and other parts of the country will, while we write, probably become British possessions. The possession of the province of Arracan has been ofthe utmost importance to the British Government, in a cot cial aud political point of view. Tbe exports of rite Mini salt to Bengal, the Coromandel Coast, and the Ten.. provinces, give employment to seveu or eight hundred small vessels annually ; while the position of the troops at Akyah ami Khyouk Phoo enables us to watch and check the opera- tions of the Burmese, when the caprice or bad faith i sovereign of Ava threatens a descent, or other distiii of existing relations. The population of A_rracan, which includes two millions and a half of souls, may be divided into three elasst a ; the Mughs, or proper Arracanese, and Burmahs ; the Mussul- mans and the hill tribes, the chief of which are the Koon- rees ; the Tong Moos, the Keangs, and Karains. There are also a considerable number of recent settlers from Bt both Hindoos and Mussulmans, but chiefly the latter. The kings of the country before the Burmese invaded it, about the year 1783, were Mughs, but in 1784 the royal family were carried off to Ava, from which time the country remained subject to the Burmese, until 1825, when they were expelled by the British forces sent from Bengal. In disposition the Mughs and Burmese are frank, manly, and straightforward ; they are also kind and hospitable, with much more of independence and good-nature than syco- phancy or meanness in their bearing, and they are of an obliging and forgiving nature, but improvident and averse to labour, much given to gambling and drinking, aud extremely passionate ; the Burmese are particularly so, and very sanguinary ; perhaps the greatest blemish in the character"], [301, "277 nABITS OF THE MUGHS. of both races is the unmerciful manner in which, when excited, they beat their wives, not unfrequently endangering their lives ; nevertheless, they are not without affection, and both sexes are very fond of their chsidren. The women are reckoned faithful, and are allowed to go about without any restraint \u2014 they are as industrious as the men are idle. The whole labour of the house falls upon them : the}' go to market, fetch the food, the water, and every necessary ; they beat out the rice, cook the meals, make cloth for the whole family, and even assist their husbands in the field and in looking after the cattle. The marriage tie is, however, held in but slight respect amongst the Mughs, and divorces for trifling causes are common. The Burmese regularly court their wives, and after the consent of the parents has been obtained, a day is fixed for the wedding, and asi the friends and relatives of the parties are invited to a feast at the house of the bride's father ; after the dowry has been settled, they all sit down to the feast, the bride and bridegroom eat out of the same dish, which binds the contract, and they are declared to be man and wife ; the son-in-law often remains a member of the family tisi his wsi'e desires a house of her own and he can afford one. The Mughs go through the same ceremony, with this difference, that when young, the match is made for them by their parents, and they never see each other tisi the marriage day ; but widowers or grown-up lads do not attend to this, but generally choose for themselves. When a divorce is sought for by both parties, nothing more is requisite than that they should go before a village assembly, and make a declaration of their wishes. Their property is then equally divided, and they separate, probably to rejoin as soon as some httle feeling of anger subsides. When the husband wishes to separate from his wife against her will, he must give up all the property, and take upon him all her debts, and leave the house with nothing on but his gombong and dhootie ; but should a woman seek a divorce from her husband, she has only to tender to him, before a competent judicial authority, the sum of twenty-five rupees, which by law he is in ordinary cases bound to accept, or at the utmost she returns her husband the ornaments he may have given her, also repays the sum of money he gave"], [302, "278 FUNERAL OBSEQUIES. her parents on the wedding, which is usually all the cost to him of the marriage, and then the release is effected by the wife breaking a paun-leaf in two, eating one-half h and giving the other to her husband. Should there be any children, they are in all cases divided according to their sexes, the boys being given to the father, the girls to the mother. They are considered far Ii burthen in a country where food is abundant, and a liveli hood so easily obtained. Tbe Mughs have no fixed method of disposing of their dead; the more orthodox plan is to burn; the poor, fmw ever, usually bury them. The coffins, which arc used alike in burning and burying, of persons of any substance, arc in the shape of a sarcophagus, and if the family can afford it they are often richly ornamented with tinsel and so forth : in this the corpse, dressed in a new suit of clothes, is laid face downwards, a piece of gold or silver coin, or a jewel, being put in the mouth, the great toes and the thumbs are tied together, and if a female, six pieces of wood are laid on the back, if a male, only three. When a female dies pregnant, she is not burnt, but buried, the child being first cut out of the womb and interred along side of the mother ; lepers, temple-slaves, suicides, victims of cholera, criminals, and all those considered unclean, ought to be buried, not burnt. The chief priests and men in power are generally embalmed, and their bodies preserved for some years, after which they are burnt with great cere mony ; quicksilver is the principal ingredient used in cleaning the intestines ; music and dancing take place at the funerals of those who can afford to pay for it, and a feast is given to the neighbours seven days afterwards, at which, although Bhuddists are prohibited the use of liquor on any occasion, it often happens that a scene of much dissipation and riot takes place. The day after the funeral, the famsiy repair to the spot where the body has been burnt or buried, and spread food for the deceased. The children are usually named three or four months after their birth. The astrologers fix the name and the day, and the parents give a feast, at which there is music, dancing, and great revelry. The people of Arracan, of whatever class or denomination,"], [303, "279 BURMESE FOOD. all live in houses, built of posts and bamboo-mat wasis, the flooring being raised four or five feet from the ground, and the roof made of bamboos and leaves. Young men who are bachelors do not sleep in their fathers' houses, but each village has a separate busiding for the young men, where they sleep by themselves. They are fond of wrestling, dancing, and various games. Although forbidden to take the life of any animal, the Mughs and Burmahs pay as little attention to this command ment as to that against drinking. They are luxurious, but at the same time dirty in their eating, and there is scarcely any species of animal, from the elephant to the frog and snake, that the poorer classes wsil not eat, except dogs, cats, and rats, and even these the hsil tribes eat readily, and it matters not whether the animal has died a natural death or been ksiled. Fish and the flesh of the superior animals, such as bullocks, deer, goats, &c, are much sought after ; rice is the staple article of food with all classes, and the mess is rendered savoury by the addition of salt, ngapee, or bala choung (which is a compound of decayed shrimps and other sniasi fish), chillies, ginger, turmeric, and numerous kinds of vegetables. These are arranged around the large dish of rice, in small China cups, and give to the repast a rather refined appearance ; msik, oil, or ghee, are rarely partaken of. The favourite drink of the Mughs and Burmese is tarree or the juice of a species of the palm, which also furnishes the leaves used in thatching their houses. It is sweet, slightly intoxicating, but harmless ; strong spirits are also distilled from rice ; asi classes chew the paun and betel- nut mixed up with khut, tobacco, and lime ; and so universal is the habit of smoking tobacco, that even chsidren of four years old may constantly be seen with a cigar in their mouths. Both men and women are robust in form, but they are not a handsome race ; they are, however, fond of finery. The men usually wear a head-dress, or gombong, composed of book muslin twisted round, but not over the head, and it is often gracefully entwined with their long hair, which they prize so much that it is not uncommon for them to wear false hair ; a jacket which is tied at the throat and closed over the chest and reaches half-way down the thigh, and a"], [304, "280 COSTUME OF THE BURMESE. dhootie, often of brilliant-coloured silk, complete their costume. The women go with the head bare, but tin is neatly braided off' and tied in a knot behind ; a red is wrapped tightly round the bosom, from which descends a petticoat, which, in the case of Burmese, Ls generally very gaudily coloured, and open up one side, so that in walking, much of the leg and even thigh is often exposed. The petti coat of the Mugh women is usuasiy less gaudy ami . decent in its dimensions. They also wear a loose muslin jacket reaching to the middle, with tight sleeves and a gay cotton handkerchief thrown carelessly over the head or shoulder. The young girls are sometimes very pretty and always merry-looking. The Mussulmans of Arracan are supposed to be the descendants of slaves imported from Bengal by the great people in early times, and one portion of them, called Kumauchees, chiefly resident in Ramree, were formerly the body-guard archers of the Rajahs of Arracan ; these have no knowledge of the use of the bow, and liave become dyers in indigo, merchants, tfec. The Koonrees, Taugmros, Kyengs, and Karains, are mountaineers hving in a state of barbarism ; they build their houses entirely of bamboos, and very high from the ground, and sive in communities of from fifteen or twenty to forty or fifty families. They change the site of their tillage every second or third year as the sosi on the hisi sides in their neighbourhood becomes exhausted. They are frequently at war with each other, but such as have descended into the low country, and there occupy the isolated ranges of small hsils, are very quiet and inoffensive people, though much addicted to drunkenness, for the gratification of which vice they distsi a very potent siquor from rice. They are of a very roving disposition, and on the occurrence of any unusual sickness or misfortune, immediately remove the whole village to a new site. Their attachment to their native mountains is, however,, very strong ; and those who have been driven by the oppression of other tribes to seek a residence in the islands or the plains, even collect the ashes of then dead, and on the first opportunity, be it years afterwards, convey them back to their native country. Nothing wsil induce them to intermarry with any other people, or inhabit a Mugh"], [305, "281 MOUNTAINS OF ARRACAN. tillage. In language, and indeed in every respect, they are a distinct people : they wear scarcely any clothing beyond a rag round the loins, and another round the head, and in cold weather the rich have a cotton wrapper or chudder over the shoulders ; they have no religion, but worship nature, and perform various ceremonies to propitiate the Nats or demons ; they are not litigious, but very revengeful ; and although in some instances a compromise may be effected for any injury, yet in general the loss of life can only be satisfied by taking the life of the offender. The women appear to have formerly set a high value on chastity, for they still adhere to a singular custom of making their faces quite blue by tattooing them in a frightful manner, which is supposed to have originated in a desire to disfigure their beauty, for which the}' are said to have been so celebrated, that they were eagerly sought after, and seized, as slaves and concubines, by their more powerful neighbours, who greatly esteemed them. The custom is said to have much declined since the introduction of British rule, and may certainly be very safely abandoned, for the mountain population are extremely ugly and abomi nably dirty : they eat and drink everything that comes in their way, and are most perfect savages. The estabhshed religion of Arracan, under the native sovereigns, was Bhuddism, and of Mughs and Burmese Bhuddists there are now about 206,000 in the province. They reject the immortasity of the soul and the existence of a hving God. They believe in the influence of superhuman powers, both of good and of evsi, and expect after death repeated transmigrations, either for better or for worse, according to their conduct in this life, and ultimately entire absorption and cessation from asi future troubles. They have no castes, and are free from bigotry ; still, were a Bhuddist to eat with some of the lower castes of Hindoos, such as Dooms, sweepers, washermen, barbers, bearers, and some particular classes of their own creed, lepers, temple-slaves, and unclean persons, he would be expelled from asi society. AU persons except the unclean are eligible to the priesthood. The priests, or phoongees, trust entirely to charity for their dasiy subsistence : they cook no food for themselves, lest in so doing they should take the life of any animal, but they wsil eat food dressed by others. They do not actuasiy beg,"], [306, "282 RELIGION OF THE ARRACANESE. but they go forth daily into the streets and thoroughfares, which they traverse generally without stopping ; aud if food or alms be given to them, as they expect it will be, it is put into a basket usually carried by one of their pupils, and they pass on, counting their beads, without returning thanks or inquiring what caste person gave it. They shave their heads and beards, wear no ornaments, aud go barefooted. They are usually clean, remarkably civil, and well conducts I and hospitable to strangers, and are reputed to have more learning than any other class. They are, in fact, the gratui tous teachers of the land ; all the hoys being placed under them for the purpose of being taught to read and write. The Keoungs (Temples) are most substantially and often beautifully built, and as a mark of distinction they have two or three roofs raised one above the other. Any person may visit the interior ; they are generally well stocked with numerous images of Gautama of all sizes and materials, white and black marble, alabaster, wood, stone, clay, or copper, most of which are, either wholly or partially, gUt with gold or ssiver. Glass and metal vessels, with real and artificial flowers, and various other simple articles of ornament, are also seen arranged in front of the images : immediately over them there is usually a canopy of fine cloth ornamented with gold leaf and tinsel : and black wooden cases, the pannelling of which is inlaid with httle squares of glass of all colours, surmounted by images of Gautama, and in which the priests keep their books and sacred records, occupy the back ground, and other parts of the hall. Hanging lamps, wall shades, crystal decanters, and such things, are also much sought after for the ornament of the Keoung. In all the mountains and forests of Arracan, the elephant, tiger, leopard, tiger-cat, bear, deer of various kinds, and the wild hog, are to be found. The elephant is, however, scarce on the islands, and neither it nor the tiger is to be found on Cheedooba. The bos-gaurus, the wild buffalo, the sha, an animal something hke the chamois, and a kind of wild dog or wolf, also a species of racoon, the wsid cat, the balla soor, and a kind of civet, are found in the hsils. There are no jackals, hares, or foxes, but asses and monkeys of numerous"], [307, "ANIMALS AND PRODUCTIONS. 283 kinds inhabit the jungles. Of birds, there are nearly asi that are common to Bengal, with some beautiful kinds of phea sants, including the argus species. The snakes and other reptiles seem, also, to be much the same as in other parts of India, but are not particularly numerous or troublesome ; and of fish there is an abundance of all the kinds usually found in tropical seas and rivers \u2014 the shark, crocodsie, alligator, saw-fish, turtle, sole, pomfret, mullet, rock-cod, Bkate, sword-fish, bumaloe, cockup, crabs, lobsters, shrimps, oysters, cockles, periwinkles, and various others, are in great perfection. The Mughs enumerate more than 200 kinds of fish. The botanical productions of Arracan are but little known. The bamboo everywhere covers the hsils and the lower ranges of mountains ; teak and a species of oak are also found amongst the hsils, but both are rendered valueless, as are many other magnificent timbers, the names of which are unknown, from the distance at which they grow from good water-carriage ; the red and white jarrool, praing (a kind of iron wood), the toon, sissoo, telsur (which yields dammer), gurjun (from which oil is extracted), the semel or cotton (silk) tree, peepul, and all the common trees of India, abound ; likewise several kinds of palms, from one of which (the nippah) the hquor called tarree is extracted ; sugar, also, may be made from it, and the leaves are universally used as covering to the houses. The mangrove, which is valuable as fuel, especially for steam purposes, is most abun dant, and long grass covers the waste plains. Iron is found on the island of Ramree, and so are coal and lime. The Tenasserim provinces extend from about 17\u00b0 30' to 19\u00b0 10' north latitude, between the parasiels 97\u00b0 30' and 99\u00b0 20' east longitude. Their length is about five hundred msies, varying in breadth from eighty to forty ; bounded on the north by the Thoungyeen river, on the south by the Pak-Chan, on the east by the Siamese mountains, and on the west by the sea. The superficial area is about 30,000 square msies, of which, probably, not more than one-tenth is under cultivation. The territory is divided into four provinces, viz., Amherst, Ye, Tavoy, and Mergui ; these again are divided into districts, under the superintendence of Goung- Gyaups. The only towns are those known by the same"], [308, "284 SOIL AND ASPECT. names as the provinces, and Moulmcin, the chief civil and msiitary station on the coast. The appearance of the country is extremely boii mountainous, numerous ranges of hills running through it, chiefly in a direction from north to south, except a the northern part of Amherst province, where successive ranges, rising one above the other, may be seen strt il from west to east. Extensive plains intervene a between the rivers aud the bases of the hills, and, from an elevated position, present the appearance of a dead flat, broken only by very remarkable isolated rocks of limestone formation, rising perpendicularly from the plains, in some instances to a great height. The soil in the plains is admir ably adapted to paddy cultivation, to which it is almost ex clusively applied ; whilst the banks of the rivers and the islands above the influence of the tide, which are annually inundated, and thus receive periodical deposits of rich allu vium, present a sosi suited to the growth of cotton, tol indigo, and a variety of vegetables. The islands within the influence of the tides are chiefly occupied by cocoa- nut and areka trees ; and the banks of the nullahs with nepah trees. Many of the woods in the teak-forests of Tenasserim are admirably adapted for ship and house building, but from their never having been employed, there is a prejudice against them. Of this description is the thengan, which might be had in any quantity, especially in the Tavoy province, and which is little, if at all, inferior to teak itself : there are also the pema, the padouk, and numerous others. The teak, however, is the only timber which attracts speculators, or is at all exported. This timber is found only in Amherst province. The forests are chiefly situated on the banks of the Attaran, commencing about fifty msies from Moulmein, and extending perhaps 100 miles along both banks of the river : never having been surveyed, their actual extent is not known. By order of Government, these forests were thrown open to the public in 1829 ; since which, Europeans and natives have been vieing with each \u25a0 other who should fell the largest quantity ; every patch of forest has long since been occupied, and many of the smaller patches have been exhausted. The"], [309, "285 MADRAS, only qualification required to obtain a permit to cut, has been the expression of the wish to do so, and the subscribing to a few regulations restricting the felliug of trees to such as were four feet and a half in circumference, and to such as were duly seasoned ; and engaging to pay a duty of fifteen per cent, to government on the arrival of the timber at Moulmein. The trees are usually felled by barking them all round in the months of February and March, when the sap is down. After standing in this state from one and a half to two years, they are felled and floated down during the rains; without being thus seasoned, the timber wsil not float. There are also some forests on the northern frontier river ; but there were obstacles just below the junction of that river with the Salween, which untsi lately deterred wood cutters from engaging in them. SECTION VII. THE PRESIDENCY OF MADRAS. This presidency, the most important in the early part of British Indian history, from the brilliant campaigns of which it was the theatre, now ranks low hi the scale, for the very satisfactory reason, that the country which forms its limits is in a settled state, abundantly fertile, and making a pleasant progress towards civsiization. The view of Madras, which is a place of great resort, owing to its position as the port of arrival for all those persons who are nominated to the civil and military service of the government, and to its commercial importance, is very striking. Immediately above the ridge of sand on which the surf breaks into a sparkling sheet of foam, the Custom-house, pubhc offices, and other buildings .stretch in a direct line along the beach ; and appear from the distance a street of palaces, their colonnades, verandah s, and tbe corniced edges of the terraced roofs all shining with the po lished white chunam. Trees of different kinds raise themselves irregularly behind these buddings ; and with some scattered columns, spires, and minarets, relieve by their contrast the"], [310, "286 THE SEA SHORE. glaring uniformity of the white stucco. To the right i street lies the Black-town, partially concealed by sonn tations : to the left, the esplanade, neatly planted and nuled into roads, rises with a gentle ascent towards the Fort\u2014 \" Fort St. George\" \u2014 which presents the formidable appearance of a regular fortification, with its ramparts bristling with cannon, and overtopped by the Exchange and other lofts colonnaded structures which rise within it. The wall, with its ditch and palisades, runs some distance along the shore, and is surrounded by a ridge of sand, which separates it from the gardens of the Nabob of Arcot. The bright dome of his palace, with its minarets displaying the once triumphant crescent, appears conspicuous amidst the rich foliage of 1 ii domain, which bounds the prospect in that direction. The great eyesore in such a view, is the almost parasiel succession of colours ; for instance, the green sea, white surf, red sand, the pure plaister, and deep blue sky rise one above another like hard lines in a picture. Their harshness, however, is softened by that liquid and glittering motion of the atmo sphere which mellows the general character of a scene, as varnish would do that of a painting. A heavy swell rolls on to the shore, and this, as rendering the navigation of boats a matter of some difficulty and hazard, lends to the Bcene the only excitement of which it is susceptible. Large boats, called mussoolahs, and diminutive rafters, formed of two logs of wood and termed catamarrans, are the only objects that float upon the billows and dare the hazard of a landing. The latter, paddled by two men, stripped to the skin, usually come off to vessels arriving in the roads. The boatmen bear chits (or notes) in their little conical caps, and are thus the emis saries from the hospitable residents, whose doors are o]ien to the introduced stranger. We land in the broad mussoolah boat, ingeniously rowed by a gaily-attired native crew, whose song, like that of the gondolier, keeps time to the plash of oars. As the shore is approached, they watch the action of the waves, and seizing the happy moment when a bsilow rolls towards the stern, they pull a vigorous stroke, and the boat is borne on the bosom of the surf to the appointed landing-place, whence it is dragged high and dry before another wave can swamp or even wet the passengers. The beach at Madras is studded with houses of business."], [311, "THE CLUB \u2014 FORT ST. GEORGE. 287 They are lofty and well ventilated. The hotels, to which the touters, who go off to the ships or sine the shore, invite the stranger, are wretched places, affording but little acom modation, and abounding with dirt, bad viands, and worse wines. If, therefore, the newly arrived visitor is destitute of personal friends, or those credentials which ordinarily ensure an invitation to a private dwelsing, he will do well to present himself at the Madras Club, and seek his election as a member. This club is an admirable institution. Without insisting upon an aristocratic exclusiveness, it is nevertheless strictly an asylum for gentlemen. It is well and liberally conducted, and the charges come within the means of most persons in the upper circle of society. If the stranger is not likely to be a permanent resident at Madras, a good word from his fellow-passengers to influential members on shore will procure him reception as a honorary member. Living at the club costs about a guinea (ten rupees) per diem, or something more. The accounts of honorary members are settled weekly. Fort St. George, Madras, is a regular fortification com posed of three full and two demi-bastions, the latter works resting on the hne wasi which runs en cremaisiere along the beach ; the curtains are covered by cavasiers and lunettes, The ditch is wet, except between the curtain and ravesin of the north face, which are connected by a strong caponiere, and the former covered by a tenaille. In this part a cunette is cut. The counterscarp is faced with a revetment and defended by a palisaded covert way, and a glacis which is mined. On the north side where Lally attacked, the bastion and demi-bastion are detached and the works near the sea covered by a tenasilon. Heavy guns and mortars are mounted all round, and on the line wall they are placed en barbette as close as they can be worked ; a second range from case mates defends this wall, which has more to fear from the ocean than the enemy ; as the surf, which was once half a msie from it, in bad weather breaks against it, notwithstand ing a vast psie of stones which has been thrown between them at the expense of eight shsisings a pebble. There are provisions for years, and numerous reservoirs of water, together with an admirably supplied arsenal within the fort, so that its capture by anything but an European army is"], [312, "288 THE FORT. impossible. Inside, the old Government house, on t li the original factory, still surrounded by a wall at v, In .. angles are diminutive bartizans or vantage coignes, forms one side of a square, which is completed by the main guard room, public offices, and barracks ; the pillars proje* way from the walls, and thus preserve a sort of uniformity. A few trees in the square afford some relief to the eye the great glare of white. All the pathways ar flagged, aud in the centre of the place is a circular pedestal on which is sculptured the surrender of Tippoos i lnidnn. The barracks (asi of the same structure) branch oil the square in streets, oue of which leads to a pretty church, in which numerous slabs record the decease of the great and good men who have fallen victims to the climate. A i conducts to the arsenal, the gate of which is flanked by two of Tippoo's brass tiger guns, the muzzle representing the open mouth of that animal. Others lead to the St. George and Wallajah gates, which open to the country, and are each guarded by a subaltern's party. In the Fort is an arsenal and several of the government offices. The Black Town, as its title imports, contains the residences of the natives, and the shops of Europeans and natives. The choice place of residence for the more re able orders of Europeans, is the Mount lioad .. i road, six miles in length, bordered by trees and villas. This and the South Beach are the fashionable places of resort during the evening drive. At St. Thomas's Mount, at the end of the Mount Road, the artillery are quartered near this place is the race-course, where two race meetings are annually held. We have been so precise in our descriptions of the govern ments of India, the Courts of Law, the usages of English society, and the manners and characters of the natives of India, that the task of describing the features of the second presidency is essentially narrowed. There is nothing to add to what has been elsewhere said of the army, the civil service, the clergy, tfec. It only remains to mention the chief insti tutions and establishments. The Government-house claims precedence rather from the importance of its purpose than from its magnificence. It is comparatively a poor busiding, not better than those"], [313, "PUBLIC BUILDINGS, CHURCHES. 289 occupied by many private gentlemen ; but it contains some good suites of rooms ; and a banqueting-room, some eighty yards or so from the building, is the scene of many a brilliant basi. The College Hall consists of a sibrary, a hall, where concerts and pubhc meetings are held, a museum, tfec, but the rooms are all in a dilapidated condition. There are barracks, hospitals, and a handsome church, within the fort, which is called Fort St. George, and a monument to the Marquis Cornwallis.

The titles of most of the above bespeak their uses. By some of them native schools are maintained, and there is no concealing the fact that the course of preparation therein pursued is more calculated to produce Christian converts than the most zealous efforts of missionaries bestowed upon the adult, \" wedded fast to some dear falsehood.\" Charitable Institutions, Schools, &c. \u2014 The Military Male Orphan Asylum ; the \"Military Female Orphan Asylum ; the Vepery Mission Institutions ; the Protestant Charity u"], [314, "290 charitable institutions.

We conceive it to be impossible for any Englishman to behold the above array of admirable institutions without strong emotions of pride and pleasure. They furnish n ficent evidence of the noble purposes to which various classes of our countrymen appropriate a portion of their wealth in India, and give the sie to the insinuation that tin the countiy to pluck the golden fruit from its trees, and leave it bare and miserable. The orphan, the native 1 the outcast, the Usiterate, the destitute, all are can provided with asylums, clothed, fed, and taught. Were we to be driven out of India to-morrow, we should have left behind us, in the results of instruction and in the moral example set to successors, more enduring mouumci worthy rule than the finest productions of the sculptor's chisel or the architect's ingenity. Of other societies existing at Madras for useful purposes, we have only to mention the Literary, and the Agricultural and Horticultural Societies ; and of commercial institutions there are but the Madras Bank, chartered two years ago, the Savings' Bank, and the Chamber of Commerce. The Electric Telegraph has been introduced, and wsil probably be extended to the most remote stations. The European and Eurasian population of Madras is considerable. Independently of those who are in the Government service, there are about 400, whose avocations are various. There are of commercial houses, thirteen ; of architects and sculptors, one ; of auctioneers and commission salesmen, eight > of cabinet-makers, nine ; of chemists and"], [315, "MADRAS TERRITORIES. 291 druggists, four ; of jewesiers, six ; of wine merchants, five ; of watch and clock makers, six ; of tasiors, six ; of tanners and boot-makers, seven ; of undertakers, four ; besides a number of msisiners, musical instrument repairers, five coach-makers, three saddlers, numerous missionaries, mer chants' clerks, booksesiers, gentlemen of the press, &c. There are several masonic lodges at Madras, to which the most distinguished men at the presidency belong. The cost of hving at Madras, the manner in which posice and municipal affairs are conducted, tfcc., correspond materially with the charges and usages at the other presidencies. If there be any difference it is in the superior economy of a Madras domestic establishment. Servants being less bound by the rules of caste, a smasier number suffices. The chmate of Madras is less sultry than that of Bengal, being tempered by the sea-breeze which sets iu at two o'clock in the afternoon ; the nights are lovely, and there is so httle moisture that people may sleep in the open air with perfect safety. The territory under the Madras government comprehends the greater part, if not the whole of the Indian peninsula. The most southerly cosiectorate is Tinnevelly (401 msies from Madras). It comprehends the space between 7\u00b0 40', and 10\u00b0 north latitude, and 77\u00b0 and 78\u00b0 east longitude, and is bounded on the east by the sea, and on the west by the ghauts, which skirt the coast of Malabar. The face of the country is a little undulated, but the general appearance is an extensive plain, interspersed with small hsils. The inner part of the cosiectorate is covered with cotton and cice fields, but towards the sea-shore the land becomes sandy, and abounds in cocoa-nut groves. Between Tinne veUy and Travancore ifl a chain of fortifications or lines which were at one time considered very formidable. The principal places in the Tinnevesiy district, are the populous town of Tinnevesiy, the capital, and Palamcottah, a military station of some importance. Palamcottah is a large fort, nearly quadrilateral, each side about 1,000 feet in length, with circular towers at the corners, but the whole thing is in a ruinous condition. Considerable manufactures are u 2"], [316, "292 TINNEVELLY DISTRICT. carried on in the pettah of Palamcottah. Tuticorin is the largest village in the district. It is on the lea coast, and derives its importance from the pearl fisheries. There are several good roads in the Tinnevesiy district. East and north of Tinnevesiy lies Madura (292 miles from Madras), a district of considerable extent, famous (\"\u25a0 \u00bbr its handsome and richly endowed temples, and including in its boundaries the highly venerated objects of pilgi i in the island temple of Ramisseram. Madura, m be termed the metropolis of Hindooism in Southern India In the north-western part of the province is a ran hills called the Kurragherry or Pylsey hills, tho enclosed base of which range constitutes the valley of Dindigul. The hills are thickly wooded, and abound with elephants, tigers, leopards, deer of the largest kind, bisons, bears, jungle h &c. The forests are replete with botanical riches, thus at once supplying temptations to the sportsman and the scientific explorer. Madura ami Dindigul are the principal towns in the colleotorate. The former is celebrated for its manufactures of the quality of cloths most estet by the natives, and likewise for its table-cloths, towels, napkins, and similar articles required by Europeans. A great many schools have likewise been established here hy the missionaries. The roads from Madura to Dindigul, and to Ramnad, are decidedly good. The population of this cosiectorate has been estimated in round numbers at fourteen millions. Proceeding in a north-easterly direction we enter the province of Tanjore (206 miles from Madras), a flat, alluvial delta, formed and completely irrigated hy the several branches of the Cauvery and Coleroon. The delta of Tanjore is the granary of the Madras territories. Rice cultivations extend over nearly the whole of the district, The streams branching from the Cauvery and Coleroon rivers are navigated by basket boats, wliich bring consider able quantities of iron, saltpetre, dry grain, oil, ghee, wax, tamarinds, tfec, from the Coimbatore, Salem, and Trichi nopoly districts during the freshes ; but as they cannot return against the stream, the bamboo-basket work i as firewood, and the boatman returns on foot, taking the leathern covering with him. Several handsome and useful"], [317, "293 TANJORE AND TRICHINOPOLY. bridges span the rivers in Tanjore, one of which, 320 feet in length, with five arches, was constructed by the Rajah Sevajee in 1835. On the coast of Tanjore are Negapatam and Tranquebar, each of which has fisied a place in the history of the early European settlements in India. Tran quebar was, until within a very few years, a Danish settlement. Combaconum and Managoody are Hindoo towns of some extent, containing several lofty pagodas, and a large population of Hindoos. Crossing the Coleroon from Tanjore, we find ourselves in the cosiectorate of Trichinopoly, which occupies so distinguished a place in the history of the early British struggles in Southern India. The town of Trichinopoly (207 miles from Madras) is well fortified. It is built upon the south side of the river Cauvery, the bifurcations of which, with the Coleroon, form the island of Seringbam, on which stands a magnificent pagoda, composed of seven square enclosures 350 feet distant\" from each other ; each enclosure having four large gates, with high towers placed,.one in the centre of each side, opposite to the four cardinal points. The outer wasi of this temple is not less than four miles in circumference. Near the eastern side of Seringham, is an annicut, or dyke, formed to prevent the waters of the Cauvery from descending into the Coleroon. The collectorate of Trichinopoly contains a population of nearly 700,000, and of these, 80,000 occupy the town and its environs. The people are remarkable for their manufac turing skisi. Their cloths, cigars, and jewesiery are greatly esteemed ; and especially their desicate silver filagree work and chains. The raw produce of the district consists chiefly of indigo, saltpetre, and cotton. The fortress of Trichinopoly is memorable for the siege in 1751-55, when Chanda Sahib, with his French auxiliaries, vainly for a length of time endeavoured to wrest it from Mahommed Ali, and would have succeeded, had not Clive dexterously diverted his atten tion from Trichinopoly to Arcot, of which place he had gallantly obtained possession. In a durgah, or mosque outside the town, he the bones of Chanda Sahib. And within the fortress is a road 300 feet high, on which is busit a pagoda. Trichinopoly is a considerable msiitary station. Its position at the confluence of rivers and at the point of"], [318, "294 SOUTH ARCOT. diverging roads, pecusiarly suits it for rapid communication with other parts of the territories subject to the Madras presidency. North of Tanjore and Trichinopoly lies South Arcot, in which are comprehended the towns of Cuddalore and Pondicherry. Here also on the coast is Porto Novn. brated for its iron mines and foundries. Much intersected by roads, rivers, and watercourses, communication across this district is singularly facile. Cuddalore (or Goodalore), the chief town (104 miles from Madras), is extensive and populous, and was at one time the seat of the government of the English possessions on the Coromandel coast. Here stood Fort St. David, the scene of more than one contest during the competition of the French and English iu India for pre-eminence. At Challumbrum and Trincomallee are large and lofty Hindoo pagodas, and Trivicory is worth a visit to behold tbe petrified trees with which it abounds. There are some remarkable mountains in the district, three of which at Gingee are fortified with wasis cut out of the solid rock. The province is exceedingly fertile. Oreat quantities of rice and fruits are grown here, the latter attaining the highest degree of flavour. Pondicherry con tinues a French settlement. It has its governor, its judges, officers of state, engineers, and government surveyor. The society is lively, intelligent; \u2014 thoroughly French. There is a beautiful lake about four msies from the town, and a bungalow upon a hill ; in its vicinity is a favourite place of resort with pic-nic parties. At one time, Pondicherry was the handsomest European settlement in India, but the loss of French political influence in tho country has led to its neglect by the parent state, and every where the eye encounters ruins of respectable edifices. Pondicherry is ninety miles from Madras. Northern Arcot is situated between the 12\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 of north longitude, and 78\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 east longitude. At the north-eastern extremity is the famous Pulicat lake, about thirty-three miles in length, and eleven in breadth. It apparently owes its existence to the sea's breaking through a low sandy beach, and overflowing the lands within. In the Pulicat hills, which lie to the westward of the lake, is Tripetty, a magnificent temple of stone, covered with plates"], [319, "295 NORTH ARCOT, CHINGLEPUT, NELLORE. of gsit copper. It stands in a valley in the centre of the range of hsils. Dedicated to Vishnu, or Ballajee, whose image, here worshipped with those of Lakshmi and the serpent, it is resorted to by Hindoo psigrims from all parts of India, who hold it in such intense veneration, that when they behold the hsils at the distance of many leagues, they prostrate themselves and call upon the idol's name. No Christian or Mussulman dare profane the temple by his tread. Even access to the hsils is closed against him. Arcot and Vesiore are the principal towns in this cosiectorate ; the former is seventy, and the latter eighty seven msies from Madras. Arcot was the capital of the Carnatic, when that large tract of country was under Mahomedan rule. It is memorable as the scene of Csive's noble defence after he had captured the place. Vellore is to be remembered as the scene of a serious mutiny in which the sepoys sacrificed many of their European officers. \u2014 For an account of which, see the Military Encyclop\u00e6dia. Due east of the Arcots is Chingleput, or the Jaghire, washed by the waters of the Bay of Bengal. It is 120 msies in length, north to south, but rarely exceeds forty-five msies in breadth. The district is low, interspersed with hsils, and is far from being productive. The river Palar flows through the district, which is otherwise dotted with lakes \u2014 of which the principal are Ennore, Sadras, and Pusicat, spoken of above. The chief places on the coast are Ching leput, the ancient capital, Sadras, and Madras. Of the latter town and its vicinity, a full account has already been given. Following our north-easterly course along the Coromandel coast, we step from North Arcot into the district of Nesiore, the principal town of which cosiectorate and of the same name, is 100 msies from Madras. This is a considerable district, with a population of nearly 1,000,000 souls. Fertile and picturesque, Nellore likewise enjoys a high reputation for its manufactures and its breed of cattle. There is a considerable trade in salt and salt-fish, and indigo is grown to some extent. Copper mines exist in Nellore, and have for fifty years yielded a very good specimen of metal. The south-western part of Nesiore is covered with mountains, the Addugherry, on which the copper mines are found. A road from Nellore, running along the coast, leads into"], [320, "MASULIPATAM, RAJAHMUNDRY. 296 the Guntoor district, wliich is bounded ou the south by the bay of Nizampatam, and on the north by the river Kistnah, crossing which, we enter the district of Masulipatam, . the Northern Circars. The town of Masulipatam, the of the earliest settlement of the English on the Coroi coast, is distant from Madras 285 miles. A small commerce with the bay of Bengal and the Persian gulf is carried on from this port, the chief articles being piece-goods and smill. This is the only port from Cape Comorin in tbe sou which the sea does not beat with a strong surf. A large lake called the Colair lies in this district. Projecting to the eastward and the northward of Masuli patam, is Rajahmundry, a district 100 miles in length, north and south, by 80 miles east to west. The river Godavery runs through the southern part of the district. Here also is a magnificent tank, 170 years old, formed by a large bund thrown across a pass by the hills ; it is not less than two miles and a half in length and one nisie in breadth. At Samalcottah, a town on the coast, 350 miles from Madras, there are excellent manufactures of table-cloths, napkins, and drills ; and at Coringa, a sea-port, 343 miles from Madras, ship and boat building are carried on. Vizagapatam, stretching from 82\u00b0 to 84\u00b0 east longitude, and 17\u00b0 30' to 19\u00b0 north latitude, is approached from Nellore along the coast. This is one of the Northern Circars, the boundaries of which are, on the north, Orissa ; on the east, the sea ; on the south, the Northern Carnatic ; and on the west, the Ceded districts, Hyderabad, Gondwara, and a part of Orissa. Vizagapatam is a well-watered district, although no rivers of magnitude run through it ; the small streams and lakes are numerous. Agriculture therefore flourishes. The population exceeds 1,000,000 souls, but it is liable to fluctuations from occasional famines and epidemic disorders. The chief town is Vizagapatam, distant 498 msies from Madras. Vizeanagrum is another station to the north of the chief town. Three msies from Vizagapatam, is Wattair, a msiitary station, the head-quarters of the divioional command. The climate of this district is favourable to the European constitution. The north-west monsoon sets in at the beginning of June and is over by the end of August ; the north-east"], [321, "297 VIZAGAPATAM, ganjam, TRAVANCORE. monsoon sets in at the commencement of September and lasts till the end of November ; then the dew falls in December, and the weather becomes cold. It is in the hot season that the climate is most agreeable. Crossing the simits of Vizagapatam, we are in the district of Ganjam, one of the five into which the Northern Circars are subdivided. Ganjam is 120 miles in length, north to south, and 80 msies in breadth. It embraces a population of upwards of half a misiion, a large proportion of whom are engaged in manufactures. The principal towns are, Ganjam, the capital, on the sea-coast, 697 miles from Madras ; Berhampore, famous for its silks ; Chicacole, renowned for its muslins. Wheat, sugar-cane, rice, osi-seeds, gram, and a variety of edible greens, are produced on the low level lands of the district. Sugar is manufactured and is in great request. North of Ganjam is the Chilka lake of thirty-five msies in length, which separates the Northern Circars from the province of Cuttack and the Bengal presidency generally. The lake is not more than eight miles in breadth, and is dotted with smasi islands, several of which are inhabited. Returning to the south, and proceeding westerly from Trincomalee, we find ourselves in Travancore, a native state of considerable extent. In form, Travancore is long and narrow, shut in from the mainland by a long range of moun tains terminating at Cape Comorin. It is one of the richest and most fertsie countries in India. Its surface is beautifully varied with hill and dale ; and winding streams, flowing down the mountains, preserve the vasieys in a constant state of verdure. The mountains are covered with lofty forests \u2014 fisied with teak and other valuable trees, and abounding with elephants, buffaloes, tigers, &c. The principal towns are Cochin, 500 miles from Madras ; Quilon, a misitary station, 450 msies from Madras ; Aleppee, a sea-port ; and Trichoor. The inhabitants of this province are chiefly Nairs, Man boozees or Brahmins, Syrians (Christians of the Syrian church), Romanists, Mopsilas, and Jews. North of Travancore, extending to 12\u00b0 30' latitude, and running along the western coast of India, lies Malabar, a rich province, famous for the trade carried on at the several ports of Casicut, whence the word calico, Tesiicherry, Penang, and Cannanore, the latter a military station. The vegetable"], [322, "298 MALABAR. \u2014 THE PEOPLE. productions of Malabar are innumerable \u2014 cocoa-nut, areca nut, coffee, cinnamon, pepper, tfec, grow in vast abundance at no great distance from the coast. There are not many towns of importance in the interior ; the country is chiefly divided into estates or farms situated in valleys, families living dis tinct from each other, in gardens enclosed with high banks and ditches. The population of Malabar amounts to oue million and a quarter, and it is still on thj increase. It may be divided into Brahmins, Namburies and Putters, Sudras, Mahomedans, Mopsilas, Teirs, Chumars, and Pariahs. The chief rajahs of Malabar are descendants of the Edia caste ; the mode of succession amongst them is from the sister's sons ; the women do not marry, but form connections accord ing to their own choice and pleasure, for a longer or shorter duration, for the most part with Malabar Brahmins \u2014 thus are propagated the heirs of all the Malabar principalities. The customs amongst the Nairs are much of the same nature; the women indulge, with more or less freedom, with various men of their own or other higher castes. The Namburies, so called from the word Nambootery, literally meaning faith less, which appellation they obtained from forsaking their own country to reside in Malabar \u2014 rank above the Putter. The eldest member of a family is alone permitted to marry ; asi the younger brothers form connections with women of the Nair caste, who consider it a great honour to receive the embraces of men of this caste. From the unhappy customs of the Namburies not permitting the junior male members of the famsiy to marry, many of the unfortunate women are led to form illicit connexions with men of their own and other castes, which, on discovery, ensures their ejection, when they are taken by any of the lower castes, who receive them as concubines. The Teirs in their customs and habits resemble the lower castes in the Carnatic. The Mopillas (literally meaning Amma pesiie, Mother's son) are the descendants of some Arabs that were stranded on the coast some centuries back, who formed connection with women of the lower castes of the country, from whom the present race have sprung up ; they are a fine, athletic, enterprising race, and are daring gang-robbers and smugglers. The Chumars of Malabar have never been considered lawful objects of sale, like Chumars in the full extent of that term, unless"], [323, "299 THE CHUMARS AND NIADIES. they happen to be made over as a part of the stock at the time their master shall have disposed of the land on which they live. The inhabitants believe they were created by Pareshwa Rama for the use of the Brahmins : by some it is supposed they arc the descendants of the aborigines who were conquered by the Cola kings and fled to the woods, but afterwards, preferring slavery to starving freedom, gave them selves up as slaves to tisi the sosi. There is, however, another caste in this district far below the Chumars, viz., the Niadies ; these poor creatures live in the woods and jungles, and are the most distressing objects of want and misery that can possibly be conceived ; they live upon wild roots and what they may be able to obtain in charity from travellers, after whom they howl and cry, running at a short distance, tisi relieved ; they are held in such utter detestation by all castes, that they are not.asiowed to approach the dwellings of their fesiow mortals. If they happen to get any money from a passenger they deposit it on a stone at some hundred yards from a bazaar, then retire and cry out in a loud voice to the bazaarman, who brings what they require, takes the money, and deposits the articles wanted, which they carry away, leaving it to the honesty of the man to give what quantity he thinks fit, for the money received. Notwithstanding their abject and degraded condition, they have more morality, and possess more good feeling amongst themselves, than other castes \u2014 they marry; infi delity is quite unknown ; and they are strangers to theft and falsehood ; the Nairs have great faith in their super human knowledge ; they are consulted when a member of the famsiy is sick ; are said to be accurate in their predictions as to the life or death of the sufferer, predicting the very day he is to die ; this superstitious besief of the Nairs induces those that have consulted them to contribute towards their support by annual donations on their birth-days, tfec. The Niadies are supposed to be the descendants of an outcast Brahmin famsiy, sentenced by one ofthe rajahs for some sin committed in the Devassom : the names of the present race are the same as those borne by Brahmins. The Pariahs of Malabar are not much above the Niadies, and though free, are far below the Chumars, and are held in utter abhorrence and scorn by the Shoodras, whom they"], [324, "300 MALABAR AND CANARA. cannot approach nearer than seventy -two paces : whilst the distance required to be kept by the Churmar is only t\\. \u2022 four paces, that of the Niadies, ninety-six paces ; these customs only exist in regard to the Shoodras aud Teirs ; the low castes may approach theMopillas and enter their houses. Religion and Sects. \u2014 The inhabitants may be di into pagans, 844,186, and Mahometans, 282,027. J. large towns there are about 300 Protestants and 1 Roman Catholics. Malabar contains four Protestant ehui viz., one on the Neilgherry hsils, one at Cannanore, one at Tellicberry, and the other at Cochin. Four Roman Catholic churches are also to be found at these places, anil fourteen at other smaller stations ; there are also many richly endowed heathen temples. Malabar will recall to the reader of history, the early visits of the Portuguese to the rulers upon the coast. In the extensive Roman Catholic population, amounting to at least 15,000 souls, and in the size and number of the churches, we have undoubted evidence of the firm hold which the disciples of the propaganda fides established upon the minds of the people ; two centuries have not sufficed to efface the traces of the industry of the Jesuits, and the zeal of the Roman Catholic missionaries. The province of Canara is to the north of Malabar. It is divided into south and north Canara, anti possesses all the characteristics of the contiguous province. Commerce on the coast, \u2014 Canara being the outlet for the produce of the Mysore country \u2014 and sport on the mountains, form the main occupations of the people. There is, however, much poverty among them, because the institution of caste ope rates as a bar to the change of a profession or calling from that which has been proved to be unprofitable to that which may be advantageous. Numerous rivers flow through the province, and the principal town is Mangalore (440 mdes from Madras), a flourishing place, standing on a smasi penin sula, formed by a lake or backwater, separated from the sea by a beach of sand. The northern extremity of Canara abuts upon the Por tuguese possession of Goa, and of course forms the limits of the Madras government on the Malabar coast."], [325, "301 salem, coimbatore, mysore. There remain but few provinces to note in the interior. North and west of Trichinopoly and South Arcot, flanked on the east by Coimbatore, is Salem, remarkable for its cotton manufactures, and the fine quasity of its general pro duce. The district is elevated, generally open, with occa sional ridges and clusters of hisis, mountains rising on the western boundary. The Shevary, hills in the vicinity of the town of Salem (210 miles from Madras), are much resorted to by Europeans for the advantage of change of air. The highest hsil, Mootoo Naad, stands about 5,000 feet above the level of the sea. It has a table-land seven miles by three, on which coffee of a good quality is produced, together with wheat, barley, and msilet. Iron ore is likewise found in abundance at Salem. West of Salem is the elevated province of Coimbatore, separated from the former by the river Cauvery. It is a flat open country, for the most part yielding large stores of dry grass and tobacco. The jungly part ofthe province affords a field for the sportsman, for the larger species of-wsid animals abound. The climate of Coimbatore in the lowest parts (its minimum height from the sea is 900 feet), is cooler than that of the coast, because for every 200 feet of elevation, we get one degree of reduced temperature. The thermometer in the month of December falls to 62\u00b0, and rarely rises to 80\u00b0. Iron and steel, and saltpetre, are among the productions of Coimbatore, and silk is manufactured to some extent. West of the central part of the province rise the Neilgherry Hills, which bave for some years been a favourite resort with invalid Europeans. On the north-western boundary of Coimbatore, is Mysore, erst the kingdom of Hyder Ali and his son Tippoo Sahib. It is divided into three great districts for the purposes of revenue management. These are Chittledroog, Nuggur or Badnore, and Seringapatam. Every variety of appearance distin guishes this fertile province. Hsils and level land, every where intersected by rivers and rivulets, the forests abound ing with valuable trees, and the plains teeming with grain and fruits, render it a most inestimable possession. The total population exceeds 3,000,000, the greater portion of whom are Hindoos, notwithstanding that for a quarter of a"], [326, "302 BANGALORE. century the country bowed to the Mahommedan yoke Upon a lofty part of the province is the British military station of Bangalore. Bangalore has always been distinguished throughout the Madras presidency for its festivities. It possesses very some assembly-rooms, and a theatre, in which the an performances are often above par. Th^ fancy balls are upon a grand scale ; and whei society happens to be composed of choice spirits, amusements of this nature go off with great eclat. The superior size and loftiness of reception-rooms in India rentier them much better adapted for large assemblages than those belonging to the same class of society in England ; and even in th sultry seasons, less inconvenience is sustained from the heat, the nights being always comparatively cool, and a free circulation of air secured by the multitude of open doors. During the cold season, the European residents of Bangalore amuse themselves with pic-nic parties, as there are numerous objects of curiosity in the vicinity to attract the visitant. There is nothing throughout Hindostan to equal the remains of Southern India ; the pagodas of Benares, and even those of Bunderabund and Muttra, are mean1 in compari the splendid temples which are spread along the plain, of Mysore and the Carnatic. Those in the neighbourhood of Bangalore do not yield in magnificence to the most celebrated pagodas of the peninsula, aud they are the favourite resort of asi who possess any taste for architectural beauty ; while; to the less intellectual portion of the community, the 1 dancing, the banquet, and perhaps above all, the feats of jugglers, offer high gratification. Though not equasiing in aspect the luxuriant, though deleterious beauty of the adjacent territories, it is' prettily situated in a moderately-wooded and well-watered country : there are barracks for two Royal regiments, one of cavalry and one of infantry ; and, in addition, the garrison consists of three native infantry and one cavalry regiment, with a proportionate number of battasions of artillery, the requisite staff, &c. The Madras jugglers are famous asi over the world ; and though the exhibition of similar acts of dexterity is often more extraordinary than pleasing, the display of leger-"], [327, "303 THE MADRAS JUGGLERS. THE COBRA. demain in India would almost induce the behef that the 'age of necromancy had not passed away. The bodies of the Madras jugglers are so lithe and supple, as to resemble those of serpents, rather than men. Swallowing the sword is a common operation even by those who are not considered to be the most expert ; and they have various other exploits with naked weapons of a most frightful nature. A more agreeable display of the lightness and activity which would enable the performers to tread over flowers without bending them, is shown upon a piece of thin linen cloth stretched out ssightly in the hands of four persons, which is traversed with out ruffling it, or forcing it from the grasp of the holders. The lifting of heavy weights with the eyelids is another very disgusting exhibition. Some of the optical deceptions are exceedingly curious, and inquirers are to this day puzzled to guess how plants and flowers can be instantaneously produced from seeds. The Madras jugglers travel to all parts of India ; but it is not often that the most celebrated are to be found at a distance from the theatre of their education. Snake charmers are common everywhere ; they belong to a pecu liar cast of Hindoos, and though their reputation is upon the wane, they stsil excite considerable curiosity in Southern India. The cobra capella is the dancing-snake of the East, and the production of the snake-stone is exclusively confined to this species. There is not, it is said, much difficulty in extracting the poison of a serpent, which is contained in a very small reservoir, running along the palate of the mouth, and passing out at each fang. The natives are supposed to be very dexterous in forcing their captives to eject this venom, and are then enabled to handle them without the least danger. Some persons, however, wesi acquainted with the habits of snake-charmers, deny that they extract the poison, and attribute the impunity with which they handle these dangerous reptiles to their accurate knowledge of the temper and disposition of the animal, and their ready method of soothing down irritation. The natives boast the possession of various antidotes to the bite of a snake, and often pretend to have imbibed the venom and effected a cure. There is a plant which goes by the name of choudraca, in which considerable confidence is placed ; and arsenic,"], [328, "304 SERINGAPTAM, COORG, BELLARY. which enters very largely into the composition of tho cele brated Tanjore pill, is often employed as a con power. Volatile alkalies are most general 1\\ pean practitioners, and very often prove successful ; but the different degrees of strength in the venom of snakes render it doubtful whether, in the worst cases, they would have any beneficial effect. Some medical men aver, that th of a cobra capella in full vigour, and in possession of all ifc poisonous qualities, is as surely fatal as a pistol-ball ; and that it is only when this poison is weakened by expenditure that medicine can be of any avasi. \u2022 Situated on a small island in the river Cauvery is the famous fortified town of Seringapatam. The island is four miles in length, and one and a half in breadth, and is far from being a healthy place. In the neighbourhood of the town, amidst some choultries and musjeeds, is the mausoleum of Hyder Ali and his son Tippoo. The garden, house, and pavilions of Tippoo are open to Europeans, and are frequently occupied by officers whose duty or curiosity leads thera to the island. West of Mysore lies the principality of Coorg. This dis trict is upon the summit, though occupying but a small por tion of the range of mountains which formed the ancient boundary of Kerala. For the most part, the country is forest land of singular fertility, 5,000 feet above the level of the sea. To the westward of the ghauts the woods decrease in density, and cultivation becomes more apparent. There are no rivers or tanks in Coorg, but mountain streams supply abundance of water for purposes of irrigation and domestic consumption. The climate of Coorg is cool and agreeable in the vicinity of Maddakerry, the principal town, ai d in tin open parts of the land to the northward. Elsewhere, the advantage of a high temperature is neutralized by the humidity arising from so considerable an accumulation of vegetation, and fever consequently is common. The arts and manufac tures are in a very low state in Coorg, and the agriculture of the country still admits of considerable improvement. Bellary is a district covering the north-eastern extremity of Mysore. The river Kistnah separates this, the principal of the Ceded districts, from Hyderabad. It stands (at a distance of 316 msies from Madras) on the table land of"], [329, "305 GEOLOGY OF BELLARY. some ghauts which rise precipitously from the plains like a wasi of mountains. Bellary is a military station as well as a cosiectorate, and is siked for the excellence of the climate. The country is fertile, and teems with an industrious Hindoo population. Captain Newbold has contributed the follow ing observations on the soil : \u2014 \" The rock on which the fort of Besiary stands, as well as the adjacent rocks, are of granite, in some places intersected by green stone dykes. Granitoidal gneiss, sometimes imbed ding garnets, constitute the prevailing rock on the plain from which, at the distance of five or six msies west from the can tonment, rises a range of hsils 'composed chiefly of a chloritic slate, crested with angular masses of a rock composed of a jaspery clay, highly impregnated with iron and a chert-like quartz in alternate lamin\u00e6. The highest of the range is known by the name of the copper mountain, from its con taining that metal. The ore, which is the green carbonate of copper, is found in the slate clay at the base of the crest of the southern epaulment of the hill. Excavations are still to be seen, said to be the remains of mines excavated here by order of Hyder Asi, but which were given up in conse quence of the expense exceeding the produce. The soil in the vicinity of Bellary is, generally, Regar or the black cotton ground, based on a calcareous deposit of Kanker, except in the neighbourhood of granitic elevation or protruding beds of gneiss and large pegmatitic veins of quartz and felspar, where it is formed by the debris of these rocks, which decom pose into a sight red soil, termed Mussub, by the natives. The Regar produces two kinds of crops, known to the natives by the terms Mungari and Kingari. The Mussub is capable of producing the former only. This sosi is sometimes exten sively deposited in low situations by the force of streams or torrents of rain, when it becomes a terrein de transports or alluvial sosi. The garden soil of Besiary generasiy consists of Regar and Mussub sosi, mixed with manure of decayed animals and vegetable matter.\" Cuddapah, a cosiectorate east of Bellary, is likewise occupied by a portion of the Madras army. The town (166 miles from Madras) stands on the banks of the Cuddapah river, which rises in the hills to its south-east. Cuddapah was for many years the capital of an independent Pathan state, X"], [330, "306 HYDERABAD. which long survived the destruction of the Deocanee dynasties. It is a quiet place, of small commercial importance, but sugar and molasses (jaggaree) are made in the adjact North of Cuddapah is Kurnool, a strongly fortified pluce iu the Balaghaut province. Until 1839, it was th of a petty Pathan chief who, revolting, gave a great deal of trouble to the British government. North of Bellary, in the centre of a valley sun hills of moderate height, diversified by the bold, rugged of some, and the picturesque and romantic appearai others, stands Hyderabad, the Mahomedan capital o Deccan, and of the states belonging to the Nizam. The view of the city, from the hill through which the road ________ the military cantonment of Secuntlerabad leads to the 1 1 residency, is commanding and extensive. Due .\"tu immediately in front, is seen the city, expanded over siderable space, and gradually losing itself in the perspective distance. From this hill appears a rich variety of mo palaces, houses, and other edifices, interspersed with which give to the whole the character of a city built iu the midst of an immense garden. The most prominent i which engage the attention are Char Minar, or four mu the Musjid Juma, or great mosque ; and the Burra I palace, with twelve gates, of a former prime minister of the Nizam. To the west, at the distance of about eight stands the strong fortress of Golconda, on a rock od eminence, in the adjacent plain of which are six or noble mausolea, built in the Saracenic order of architecture, the sepulchres of the Kutb Shahi dynasty of the Y Golconda. Descending the hill and proceeding towai city, the view becomes gradually less extensive until the traveller arrives at the suburbs, a great part of which M called, pcvr eminence, \"the Residency,\" as contain. establishment of the Company's Resident at the court of his Highness the Nizam. Between this [art of the subui the city runs a small stream, which, in the rainy season, he. - ever, swells to a river of considerable width and rap course. Here is seen the massive stone wall which sui Hyderabad, supposed to have been built byKooli Knot. Shah, the fourth monarch of that dynasty. This wall, in some places, owing to the unevenness of ground, reaches the"], [331, "307 HYDERABAD. of forty feet ; but its average altitude on the outside is about twenty feet, and its thickness ten feet. The height of the side within the city is much less. There is a rampart suffi ciently broad for four persons to walk abreast, and a parapet, about five feet high, through which loop-holes are pierced for musketry. This, if properly defended, must have been a strong protection to the city from the attacks of a native army. The stream just mentioned is called Musi, by the natives, and winds its course about half round the city. From the rampart is a fine view of this river and the sur rounding country, particularly on that part of the wasi to the right of the Deldi gate on entering the city, when an interesting and picturesque sight presents itself, of elephants, with their variegated howdahs, rich caparisons, and gor geously painted trunks ; native, Persian, Pathan, Turkoman, Affghan, and Arab horsemen, together with camels and their riders, palankeens, and foot-passengers continually passing to and from the city, and crossing the ford, as there is no bridge over this part of the river. Within the city of Hyderabad are some extensive edifices and gardens, laid out in a tasteful and elegant manner. Of these, the most remarkable are the hurra dari, a word appsied to the palaces and mansions of the newabs and rajahs, as they were originasiy erected with twelve gates to them. They consist of a range of busidings of stone and wood, generally detached from each other and separated by quadrangular areas, some of which are flower-gardens ; in some are reservoirs of water, containing rare fishes, and in others a variety of playing fountains and jets-d'eau. At one end of others, again, are artificial cascades, constructed in such a manner as to be capable of having their falling waters either accelerated or retarded according to pleasure. Most ofthe edifices are two or three stories high, and bave veran dahs round the compartments of the ground-floor, with slight psilars, painted green and occasionally gsit. The administration of the civil affairs of Hyderabad rests exclusively with the Nizam himself, and it is, therefore, needless to say that it is characterized by all the vices which distinguished native rule in the olden time. His Highness has, however, recognised the importance of some European institutions, and among them we may record with pleasure x 2"], [332, "308 THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. the successful establishment of a Medical School. The Hyderabad Medical School was instituted, not for tht pose of training young East Indians for the subord Medical branch of the public service, but with the ri thoroughly educating a body of native private practit who should extend the blessings of European medicine and surgery to their sick and maimed fellow-countrymen in the neighbouring city of Hyderabad, and thus supplant bi - the many ignorant hakeems who impose and prey up dense population of that locasity. How far the institution has answered the end proposed, let the follownig brief nar rative testify. A short time ago, at the requisition of the Resident and with the sanction of the Governor-General, a Commi. three Medical Officers, including the Superintending Surgeon of the Hyderabad Subsidiary Force as a President, was ap pointed to examine several students of the school, with a view to their being furnished with diplomas, authorising them to practise medicine, surgery, and midwifery, Tho standard of examination adopted was that of the London and Edinburgh Royal Colleges of Surgeons, and five days were occupied in testing the acquirements and qualifications of the eighteen candidates, who presented themselves I the Committee. Of the number, ten passed a highly credit able examination in anatomy, physiology, Materia Medica, surgery, practice of medicine, and midwsi'ery ; three in all these subjects except surgery, which tiny had not yet studied ; and one, a Persian, acquitted himself with much distinction in the only three of the above-named branches that had engaged his time and attention : \u2014 the remaining four were rejected. An interesting and gratifying finals to this ordeal was the meeting, at the school, in July, 1853, of the Resident, Colonel Low, and his assistants, with several msiitary and medical officers from Secunderabad and Bolarum, and numerous native friends of the pupsis, to see the Nizam \u00bb Minister, Salar Jung, present the successful candidates with their diplomas. After the official report of the Examining Board had been read aloud, both in Enghsh and Hindoo stanee, and a subsequent short but satisfactory examination of the students by three of the medical officers present, Dr. Maclean, the superintendent and sole instructor us the"], [333, "NIZAM'S ARMY. 309 school, read the Sponsio Academica, which each candidate signed, and then received from the minister's hands his diploma, bearing -the seal of the Nizam's government. As additional evidence of success attained by the insti tution, and an earnest of still greater, we may mention that some of its alumni have already established a high reputation as medical practitioners in Hyderabad \u2014 one iu particular, Mahomed Ushruff, the most proficient among them, has dis tinguished himself by the sksiful performance of several capital operations in surgery, and derives a handsome income from his practice. They will asi hereafter be further encou raged in their professional labours by the smile of official approbation, for the minister, Salar Jung, highly gratified by their great attainments, has pledged himself to employ them in the pubhc service. Some British troops, forming a portion of the Madras army, and called the Hyderabad subsidiary force, garrison Secunderabad ; but the Nizam is also sustained by a contin gent, officered from the British army. This service is com posed of five regiments of cavalry, four companies of artillery, one company of sappers and miners, or engineers, as they are sometimes called, eight regiments of infantry, one garrison, and one invalid battasion. The horse, or, as it is termed, the reformed horse, are a fine body of men (Moors, of course, in the greatest ratio), four corps of which are similar in most respects of duties, discipline, and interior economy, to the Bengal local horse corps. The remaining, or fifth, regiment is disciplined and conducted on the plan of regular native cavalry corps. The arms and accoutrements of the cavalry are similar, in most respects, to the Bengal and Bombay local corps. They consist of sword, spear, and pistols ; black leathern belts and jack-boots ; dress uniform, in the native fashion, of dark green ; * a red turban generally ; but on these points the general orders are not very strict, as amongst some of the men, and in one or two of the regiments, variety is considered * The riesaldar gets 500 rupees per month pay.

Their strength and equipm according to the quantum of ordnance belonging to each. It is understood, however, that the zeal ami slunJch (fancy) of the commandants have much to do with these departments. Every company has, nevertheless, four six-pounders and a brace of eighteens, to which are occasionally added a mortar and one or two howitzers ; and when this is the case, the ordinary strength of each company is enlarged. The usual complement of a company is about sixty -five or seventy men. Two conductors and a quarter-master's serjeant assisi artillery captain-commandant, besides the soobadar and jemadar of the company. The clothing, accoutrements, and discipline are exactly similar to those adopted in the Com pany's service, and plenty of powder and a few rounds of ammunition balled, are allowed for practice. The small company of sappers and miners is a most useful and efficient body, stationary at Bolarum, under a command ant and an adjutant. The companies of artillery are also stationary, and never relieve each other. Come we next to the infantry, which are all regular, and assimilate closely in respect to duties, dress, <kc, to the Madras native infantry. Each regiment has its captain-com mandant, and the usual complement of officers, four in num ber, including the adjutant, who is allowed to hold charge of companies in turn, and according to seniority.

There is also a surgeon to each corps, assisted by dressers. Like the system in the Madras army, the chief aid to tbe adjutant in parade duties is afforded by a \"native adjutant,\" selected from the jemadars. The corps are efficient and wesi disciplined, recruited from all quarters, but chiefly from the south. There are, however, many Hindoostan men in the ranks, and these are much prized, especially if of a good height for a grenadier. The general run of the corps in height is much the same as through the Madras army, and of comparatively small stature after looking at Bengal corps. The regiments resieve each other occasionally, and remain three years, or sometimes a shorter period, at a station. The dress of the infantry is according to tbe Madras regiments, and differs httle from the other presidency soldiery. Coats are issued once in two years. Musters are taken once in two months, by the major of brigade at each division head-quarters, and the intervening months have a regimental muster on the first of each. The system on this point is quite different from that of the Ben gal presidency, and would appear to be of minor importance as a military duty. Each division station has a capital mess-house and store room attached to it, for the use of the officers. . Suppsies are chiefly procured from Bombay. Misdemeanours are tried in the regimental house by Pun chayet, and the other branches by courts-martial \u2014 division, line, and regimental Furloughs (annual) are granted to the troops ; and a pension establishment for soldiers wounded in the service, and meritorious servants after twenty years' service, is provided. Queen's and Company's officers are entitled to draw the \" pay proper\" of their grade in their own service, independent of Nizam's allowances. Officers must pass an examination in Hindoostanee before they are eligible for an adjutancy or interpretership. The allowance, however, for the latter is no great incentive to work a little harder for the latter examination, which is somewhat stricter"], [336, "312 ARMY REGULATIONS LANGUAGES. than that required for the former. But, thrown so much more, as is an officer in the Nizam's contingent, amonj, natives, we suspect there are very few who, as far as this qualification is considered, are not fully competent for situation. Pure Hindostanee is, however, not gci spoken in the Hyderabad service, from the great mix i men from both coasts and other southern districts, and the consequent jumble of Tellinghoo, Tamul, Canarese, Mahratta, aud Guzrattee, with the pure northern dialect, or Oordoo. The Hindostanee of southern India is often a straj a compound of many tongues, well worthy of Babel. All patronage in the Nizam's service is in the hands of the Governor-General. The regular portion of the service \u2014 i. e. engineers, artillery, and infantry \u2014 are directed to be guided by the regulations, standing orders, <fec, for the Madras army. The pay and allowances are higher than those in the Company's service, but they are not issued with the same regularity. The purely Oriental character of the state kept up at Hyderabad, and the hospitality of the British officers, will amply repay the traveller for a few days' stay at the canton ment. THE NEILGHERRY HILLS. Madras, sike the other Presidencies, has its sanatoria. Tlie chief of these are the Neilgherries. The Neilgherries, situated in the south of India, on the confines of Coimbatore and Malabar, extend from 11\u00b0 10' to 11\u00b0 32' north latitude, and from 76\u00b0 59' to 77\u00b0 31' east longitude. Their greatest oblique extent from south-west to north-east is from thirty-eight to forty miles, and their extreme breadth fifteen. Their superfleial area may be computed equal to 700 square miles. Four stations are at present occupied, viz., Ootacamund, Kotagherry, Dimhutty, and Coonoor. Ootacamund is the principal station, and is situated nearly in the centre of the table-land of Mysore, about ten miles from the southern edge of the range, and seven from the northern, immediately at the base, and on the western side"], [337, "313 THE NEILGHERRY STATIONS. of Dodabetta, and is open only towards the west-north-west, the other three sides being completely sheltered by this mountain. Its elevation is 7,400 feet above the level of the sea, and it is the best locahty amongst the other stations. It has decidedly the most perfectly European climate of any in these hills, and is less affected by the changes of monsoons, rains, <fec, than any other, which arises from its forming the sine of separation between the north-east Madras monsoon and the south-west Malabar monsoon. Kotagherry is situated sixteen miles distant from Oota camund, on the eastern division, and is inferior in elevation, being 6,571 feet above the level of the sea. The chmate is much milder, and the extreme and dasiy range less. The minimum is 43\u00b0, and the maximum 76\u00b0, a range of 5\u00b0 less than the extreme of Ootacamund. The air is moister and the nights less cold. In June, July, and August, the weather is clear, bright, and fair at this station, whilst at Ootacamund there is pretty constant fog, drizzle, or rain during this time. This difference arises from the former place being less subject to the influence of the south-west monsoon. It is also reckoned a more eligible residence during the monsoons for delicate people, whereas Ootacamund is decidedly preferred for those in tolerably confirmed health. Less rain falls at this place, and it is generally dry here when it rains at Ootacamund, from being affected by a different monsoon. Dimhutty is situated on a plateau between Kotagherry and the Orange Valley, the latter of which rises at the north-east angle of Dodabetta, and is so named from the number of wild orange and lime trees found in it. The elevation of Dimhutty above the sea is 4,500 feet, and its temperature is much higher than that of the two former stations. Coonoor, which is ten msies distant from Ootacamund and the head-quarters of the pioneer corps, is situated south of the range, close to the edge of the hills, and rises 5,806 feet above the sea. Its mean temperature is probably 6\u00b0 warmer than that of Ootacamund ; and from its proximity to the ghaut it is subject, at particular seasons, to fogs ; on"], [338, "314 PRODUCTS AND CLIMATE. the other band, it has the advantage of being on the direct road to Ootacamund, aud is well adapi< travellers. Over the whole extent of the table-land, and on summit of the hills, the sosi is exceedingly rich aud of con siderable depth, caused by swamps of various extent ; hut situation, exposure, command of water, and other I circumstances, confine the cultivation to the extrem the hills and to the south and east of the range. The different natural products are coarse barley, keeree mow, poppies, garlic, and onions. The following have been introduced by European visitants ; viz., wheat, oats, potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, savoys, French beans, spinage, peas, lettuces, beet-root, radishes, celery, turnips, carrots, &. sea-kale, asparagus, tomatas, plums, peaches, nectt apples, citrons, loquats. Oranges and limes grow wild. Brazil cherry, commonly known as the topara, g capers, strawberry, raspberry, blackberries are hkewise grown. The Orchis masrula, from the root of which the salpi mi. ree is obtained, is in abundance, and several other plants, resem bling the genus Orchis Lucerne. Tobacco is also found. From the elevated position of the hsils, the curative and restorative powers of the climate on Indian diseases must be apparent to all. An important consideration, also, connected with them, is the preventive powers of their csimate, which has not yet met with the attention it deserves. A transfer at once to the climate of the hills of those suffering from various diseases and asiments is highly recommended. The following complaints, for instance, find a remedy \u2014 fever, dyspepsia, debility in every degree, constipation, cutaneous affections, pulmonary complaints, diarrh\u0153a, dysentery, hepatic diseases, rheumatism, gout, and asi the complaints to which females are pecusiarly liable. The bazaar at Ootacamund is exceedingly well supplied, and the prices are a httle higher than those of the low country. There are excellent shops, containing everything in the way of liquors, and Europe supplies cheese, pickles, preserves, <fec, &c, which are good, and at reasonable prices. Salt provisions of very good quality, cured on the hills, are to be had in considerable quantities in the bazaar. Cattle and swine might be procured to any extent in the low"], [339, "315 SUPPLIES, DISTANCES. country round the hsils, and fruits and vegetables of every description have advantageously been cultivated. In Kotagherry there is a deficiency of supplies, owing to the want of a regular bazaar, a market being held only once a week. There are not many houses, besides the quarters at Dimhutty, at tbe disposal of the public, whilst at Oota camund there are upwards of 100 habitable houses. At Coonoor there is a pubhc bungalow. Good men-servants of every description (except, perhaps, head-servants and dressing-boys) are available at Ootacamund. Female-servants are seldom found, and should be brought up. Beds, chairs, tables, carpets, may be easily had on the hisis. Crockery may be arranged for with the Parsee shopkeepers. The essential requisites to be taken are plate, bed and table sinen, and warm clothing.

Warm clothing is of vital importance to invalids on the hills, and even in the low country a light flannel banian (jacket or shirt) is of service ; every invalid, as he values Hfe, should be provided with a good stock of flannel banians, flannel cummerbunds (belts, made so as to have strings to be firmly tied round the middle and double over), drawers, and worsted stockings, and a stock of stout shoes and boots. Avoid exposure to the night air, and never be out after sun set. Early rising is neither necessary nor prudent ; the invalid should wait till the sun has attained sufficient height to drive away the cold and moisture of the night ; care should be taken to return home before nine a.m., so as to avoid the powerful effects of the sun. Diet must, of"], [340, "316 CAUTIONS, ROUTES, ETC. course, be regulated by circumstances. In general, ho adhere to light animal food, with bread or biscuit, and vege tables, pastry, cheese, <fec. Port or sherry is preferable to the lighter wines ; beer unnecessary. Invalids should diminish their usual quantity of these stimulants until acclimatized, and observe early hours for diet. Exercise should be taken so as to produce a gentle action on thi and not fatigue, but avoid exposure to the sun. Riding Li to be preferred to walking, because it is less exciting. acclimatized, exercise should be gradually increased, and when fairly recovered, as much daylight in the open air as strength will permit should be passed. Those who have suffered from fever should be cautious to avoid the jungle at the foot of the hills, and if unfortunately detained there, a course of purgatives, followed by small doses of quinine, should be pursued. Cold feet (a general complaint with new comers, especially females) are remedied by adopting lambs' wool or worsted stockings, which should form the stock us people in good or indifferent health. Routes and Approaches. \u2014 There are three points of readiest access to the Nesigherry hills, viz. : Madras on the east coast ; Casicut, Cannanore, and Telsichery on the west : but the Calicut or Cannanore route is reoommended to tra vellers from the Bengal Presidency arriving at Madras, of course, in the first instance. Trichinopoly Route. \u2014 Regular bearers are to be had to Cuddalore from the Madras police, thence to Trichinopoly from the post-office there ; from this to Matapollium, where they are posted by the collector of Coimbatoor, and from Mataposiium to Ootacamund, they are to be had from the commissariat-officer on the hills. This is the most eligible though the longest road ; it passes through many stations, having medical and other assistance at hand ; is free from jungle or other obstructions, and may be travesied at all seasons, without risk or delay. The Salem Route. \u2014 The route vid Salem is the shortest, but it passes through an uninteresting and unhealthy country. There are bungalows only at certain stations. It joins the former road at Avanashy. The third road passes through Vellore, Bangalore, and Mysore, and then ascends by the Goodaloor pass to Nedi-"], [341, "ROUTES TO THE NEILGHERRIES. 317 wuttum and Ootacamund. Bearers are to be had as far as Arcot from the Madras pohce, and thence to Ootacamund from the principal offices. Bangalore Route. \u2014 This road would be the most agreeable, but on account of the jungle between Goondlapet and Goon daloor, which, however, may be avoided by descending the Tapoor pass from Bangalore, and joining the Salem road. But this route is only had recourse to by travellers from Bangalore, which is the fourth and new military road. Calicut Route. \u2014 From Calicut the road descends south ward to Ponany, and thence striking inland, passes through a beautiful country to Paulghatcherry, seventy-eight msies. From this to Coimbatoor, thirty msies, it lies partly through a jungle, not unhealthy or dangerous in any way ; from Coimbatoor to Matapollium, twenty-seven miles, and thence the Coonoor ghat leads to Ootacamund. Another road from Cahcut is by ascending the Beypoor river to Nellumboor, thence through a deep jungly valley (between the Nesigherries and the Tonbacherry hsils) to the Karkoor pass, and finasiy to Ootacamund. This route is highly objectionable, from the extent and unhealthy nature of the above jungle. Cannanore, or Tellichery Route. \u2014 This road is recom mended to such travellers from Calcutta as have no dislike to a sea-voyage, or expect to derive benefit from it. From either of these places the road strikes directly inland, and ascending the Peria pass, to Manantoddy, and passing through a wild and picturesque, though not unhealthy country, reaches Goodaloor, and thence finally enters Oota camund. SECTION VIII. BOMBAY. Although secondary to Madras in respect to the extent of territory subordinate to the local government, and con sequently inferior in the magnitude of its public estabsish ments, army, revenue, &c, Bombay has become, since the"], [342, "318 BOMBAY NEW ARRIVALS. estabhshment of a regular communication with England vid the Red Sea, a more important presidency than its neighbour. Externasiy, Bombay is particularly attractive. As th. is entered, the passenger beholds on either side mountains rising apparently at no great distance marking the western boundaries of the vast continent of India. To the left, and within half a mile of the ordinary anchorage, is tin of Bombay, fronted by a fortress bristling with forming the enclosure to the town. The stee j churches, a Protestant cathedral and a Scotch church, are the only architectural objects that rise above the mass of - ings, but sufficient is seen of the private houses running landward to indicate the wealth and populousness ofthe i Large and commodious boats resembling the famous Deal boats, and here called bunder (or pier) boats, quickly come off for the conveyance of passengers ashore, and if tin arrival has been expected, aud his or her reception arranged, it does not unfrequently occur that a bead servant, or purvoe, is the bearer of a note containing a special invitation house of some respectable resident. As yet, Bombay has made but httle progress towards the establishment oi hotels or boarding-houses. The hospitality for which British India was at one time proverbial, therefore continues in full force on this picturesque island. It does, however, happen that a party arrives at the presidency without thi tions that will ensure him a reception within a private cile, or, having them, he may find the spare rooms of his friend preoccupied, or the host himself absent from town. Under such circumstances, he has only the choice of an hotel, or of a tent upon the esplanade. Between the westernmost point of the fort and the sea-shore, a cornet of the esplanade, or plain, which stretches across the entire land-face of the fortifications, is appropriated to an en ment for the accommodation of strangers, or resident prefer the sea-breezes and a canvas habitation to tht heat of the close and dusty town. A word to one of the dubashes, a superior sort of valet de place and cicerone, who presents himself on board most newly-arrived vessels, will ensure to the passenger, within twenty-four hours, a cm i ably-furnished tent and a small retinue of servants, at an expense not greater than wsil be incurred at the hotel, and"], [343, "319 THE TOWN OF BOMBAY. with the advantage of perfect seclusion and independence. The cadet or the Queen's officer, however, whether introduced or not, is relieved of these cares for his personal comfort, as the superintending officer who has charge of the former provides immediate quarters for the newly arrived, and the latter invariably receives an invitation from the regiment quartered in the town, or Fort George Barracks, to accept the hospi talities of the mess, and is put into appropriate apartments by the barrack-master. Once landed, the stranger commences life in India, of which we have spoken elsewhere. The only difference in the style and order of life at the several presidencies, consists in the number and character of their respective places of pubhc amusement. There is a theatre but no concert-room in Bombay ; and at the former the representations, chiefly by amateurs, are rare. Still, much time might be agreeably passed, if music, as an accomplishment, were more cultivated \u2014 for it would increase sociabsiity, and win many from less graceful pas times ; but, unfortunately, asi the machinery of the fine arts is procured with difficulty, and it is therefore only among persons of extraordinary energy that their practice is con tinued. Bombay, indeed, possesses shops, and they deserve notice as a portion of its physiognomy ; but the high charges. and paucity of supplies, confined also to what is most commonly on demand, render them ill calculated to give a stimulus to the arts. The greater portion of the shops are kept by Parsees, who deal in every article required by a European, sesiing the commodities at something less than an advance of 100 per cent, on the London prime cost. A very excellent chemist's shop is estabhshed in the fort, which disseminates the blessing of soda-water over the whole presidency. But the most important want is that of a boot and shoe maker, notwithstanding that there are well-meaning but very incapable persons, natives of the Celestial empire, who wander from house to house, with white coats, red slip pers, straw-hats, flat features, and long plaited hair, holding in their hands little bundles, containing silk and satin shoes intended to fit everybody, and consequently fitting nobody. These worthy Crispins receive orders, and with bad leather, coarse sinen, and paste in abundance, essay their execution,"], [344, "THE BORAHS. 320 the result being, that the public pay for their want of skill, in the penalty of uneasy or distorted feet. Two or three Portuguese have libraries in the fort \u2014 dark, dismal places, containing a few standard and elementary works that no one ever reads, and which certainlv . rank with either cheap or entertaining literature ; but then, for reference, there is the splendid sibrary of the Town I and for purchase, the book agency established Elder, tfe Co., and the scattered volumes of a Borahs baskets purchased at the sale of an officer's effects, or perhaps bartered by a new arrival for a packet of Windsor soap, or a new bridle for his tattoo. The Borah, sike the reader of n lating sibrary, values books according to the lateness oi date of publication ; he learns the title-pages bj sets a store upon illustrations, quite indifferent whether they are of John Gsipin or the Book of Beauty. In olden times, before steamers brought out crowds of ladies attired in Parisian fashions, and before i I necessary to send to England for regular supplies of tasteful atth'e, the Borahs, who purchased vast quantities of goods strangely thrown together in the lots of a hurried au were looked to for all that was required, from a paper of pins to a ball-dress. But things have changed, and Borahs are daily becoming of less repute ; their taste is their fashions laughed at, and their self-importance shaken. One Borah was accustomed almost daily to make his appearance in a bullock-garee (cart), well covered-in, and containing three or four parcels of rich merchandise. In one was displayed a rich pile of Cashmere shawls and Delhi scarfs ; in another, fine muslins and pretty China silks ; in a third, chintzes, calicoes, crapes, and woollens. Very probably you care not for any of these things : the fat Borah wipes his brow and beckons to a cooley, whispering a word in his ear ; the man disappears, but soon returns ; in his hand is a smasi mahogany box, which he hands to his master; the Borah seeks a key, it opens, and a blaze of jewels, some of great value, glitters before the eyes of the sorely-tempted ; rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and diamonds, some well set, others in their native state. Sometimes, with humbler aim and smasier capital, laces and bobbins form the stock in trade of a simple-minded Borah ; but sometimes, again, the"], [345, "321 THE BOMBAY HORSE-DEALERS. itinerant trader deals largely in pearls, bringing with him a capacious box, containing thousands, loose and undrilled, large and small together, seising them by weight ; you take up a handful, and the owner looks calmly on, as if they were grains of corn. Next appears the vender of coral, jasper, and cornelian ; of ivory boxes and inlaid watch-stands ; but only the newly arrived or the speedsiy-departing patronise them much. It is otherwise, however, with the general or \" chow chow\" Borah, as he is casied, for his soap, pickles, whips, vinegar, cotton socks, eau-de-Cologne, essence of ginger, and orange marmalade, sind ready purchasers everywhere. As we have said, the time is at hand when the trade of the Borahs wsil cease. They are a distinct feature in the physiognomy of Bombay, however, and as such their loss wsil be regretted ; for though their eau-de-Cologne is httle better than spirits of wine, their calico too often rotten, and their Scotch marmalade the production of Surat, yet the Borah is a character, and one often possessing a great fund of drollery and good-nature. This is particularly displayed at times when the Borah is required to exchange, as well as to sell goods ; this arrangement being also part of his calling, and commonly conducted in a way that is replete with amusement to the looker-on. The Borah will purchase any thing, animate or inanimate \u2014 blankets, mathematical instru ments, goats, or horses. Occasionasiy, au old pony is exchanged for a pair of pistols, or a much-worn copy of Byron for a new buggy whip, when a great deal of rail lery is frequently carried on between the buyer and seller ; for public indulgence asiows much latitude to the Borah among those to whom his character and calling afford con stant amusement during the leisure hours of a hot day in India The horse-dealers are also among the characteristics of Bombay. In the centre nearly of the great bazaar, the stranger observes a long row of thatched busidings, sur rounded by a mud wall ; these are the Arab stables, and here is centred a considerable portion of the happiness of the male community. Lounging on benches outside the wall, are to be seen the dealers, chatting with thefr Persian friends, who are usually moonshees, in the employ of the European Y"], [346, "322 SPORTSMEN AND SPORTS. officers, or merchants in the town ; the costume of the hone dealers consists of under-garments of white oo which are robes with hanging sleeves, in colour eithi blue, or orange, with handsome waist-shawls and i i slippers J their turbans are commonly of striped sill cotton, tasselled hke the handkerchiefs of the I it and beneath these, gleam eyes radiant with the which accompanies an intimate knowledge of their peculki calling. When a boat-load of horses arrives fresh from tho Persian Gulf, nothing can exceed the excitement produced amongst the racing members ofthe Bombay Society, with that ofthe hunting portion of the world generally who may chance to be for the time at the presidency. The horses, from having been stowed closely together, with little food, less water, and no exercise, lose all their beauty of appearance, ami nre commonly reduced to mere bone and muscle ; the expei eye, however, judges better of them in this state, rou; of form being quite unnecessary for showing the real power or symmetry of a high-caste Arab ; therefore, as soon as the \" dow\" discharges its cargo, the sporting men hurry I stables, and make an immediate selection, frequently | 300/. or 400Z. for what, to an unsksiled eye, mifdi the diseased frame-work of a horse. After this, the Arab dealers exert all their skisi to pass off at the best prict nags that are considered unworthy to contest tbe glories of either the turf or the \"jungle-side,\" and this they effect with admirable jockeyship. Being all excellent riders (for clinging to a horse seems not a matter of acquirement, but of nature, with an Arab, like a sixth sense), a servant of the stables wsil fling himself on the bare back of tbe most i animal in his master's possession, perhaps, and with tangled locks, and garments wjldly flowing, gallop him backwards and forwards, while the uninitiated and hoped-for purchaser wonderingly looks on, convinced that the heavy-shouldered, hatchet-headed, zebra-striped brute before him must \u2022 perfection of high caste and fine temper, to be so nr. with a single rope-bridle and the spur of a bare heel j and in this spirit the dealer persuades his victim to give a large sum for a horse .that runs away With him the first day he mounts him, and kicks him off the second. The deluded"], [347, "323 THE BOMBAY BAZAAR. purchaser seldom likes to acknowledge this, and the dealer, therefore, hears no more of him : the dupe of his sksil hastens to barter the sil-conditioned animal with a friend, and, as \" doing business,\" as it is called, is a great amuse ment among the young men in India, the matter is soon arranged, and the original purchaser gets rid of the horse for perhaps a clever pony, a canteen, and a dozen or two of pale ale, and, after asi, when in experienced hands, the horse often turns out a valuable hunter, and earns great reputation. The sportsman dissikes Bombay ; for, beautiful as the island is, with its rocky mountain scenery, and dense jungles along the coast, studded with the cave temples of an ancient superstition, it is not a country that can be ridden over ; and although some species of game are to be found in abun dance about the underwood of Salsette, and the back of the island itself, yet the marshy character of the ground, and its sil reputation for malaria, cause shooting to be avoided, even by the most zealous sportsman. In healthy situations in Bombay, Europeans appear to retain their health better than at out-stations, which may, perhaps, be attributed to good water, and the refreshing influence of the sea-breeze ; but it is remarked, that they soon lose the healthy look which those have been able to retain who remain at the out stations, while they have a more generally desicate and palhd appearance. The damp, relaxing csimate, and the comparatively luxu rious habits of living at the presidency, may have something to do with producing this effect ; for although part of the green, near the esplanade, forms a cricket-ground, and there is a good racket- court at the entrance of the bazaar, few of the old residents avail themselves of such means of exercise, being content with that afforded by an easy palankeen or well-appointed carriage ; whsie, at an out-station, horse exercise and hunting form the chief recreation of life, and tend to balance the evsis of hot winds, sand-storms, and other miseries to which people are there subject. Few things can afford more interesting or picturesque effects than the great bazaar, beginning with the gay, open esplanade, its pretty bungalows and animated groups, with the fort and bay in advance, and ending with the dark cocoa- Y 3"], [348, "324 ARRIVALS AT BOMBAY. nut woods* in Girgaum and Mazagon, speckled with the handsome villas of the European gentry.

The number and variety of persons who now arrive monthly at the Bombay presidency lessen most materially the interest of new arrivals. Bachelors, weary of their state, no longer hurry down to catch the first glimpse of a hew belle ; nor does the sositary officer, on outpost duty, pen an elaborate proposal of marriage to a lady he has never seen, lest some happier man anticipate his hopes. A ship may arrive from London, and some individual, who has a box of msilinery or of saddlery on board, is charmed at the news, and by the same day's post writes to his agents about her ; but here it ends ; there is no general interest felt. A Liver pool brig comes into port, and no kind husband hurries on board to secure the prettiest bonnet in the captain's cargo for his wife ; nor do ladies' hearts beat more quickly at the prospect of seeing London fashions of only six months' date ; all this is changed, or changing : steam is exerting its influ ence on the whole character of India, and of its European society. There is now no longer a want of interest on site rary or other subjects. English periodicals and newspapers arrive in Bombay almost damp from the press. The Parsees are the most progressive and almost the most positively enlightened people among the natives of Western India, owing to their freedom from the shackles of caste, and mustachioed rajah, over whose head are flying tremendous nondescript animals, half-carp and half-scorpion ! The rajah is seated on a large square charpoy, or bed, the fore-feet of which are on the ground, and the hind in the sky, and is evidently smitten, not only with the nautch girls, but also with the music of a gentle swain, who discharges a torrent of sound through a fife with two holes, which he holds in his hands from right to left. The huzoor's countenance, however, is as immovably tranquil as that of Boodh ; and he appears to enjoy the most serene complacency of mind, while two of his faithful sepoys in the rear are killing an enormous tiger, with a mouth full of teeth, in the most masterly and ingenious manner ; one kneeling and covering his head with a shield, while the other, seeing the brute's attention thus happily diverted, leaps on his back, and coolly cuts him up to kabobs! Meanwhile, peacocks, monkeys, alligators, and carps, are hovering in mid-air, with the most wasteful profusion !

Of the government of Bombay, the army at its disposal, its press, ecclesiastical establishment, <fec, we have ahead. a full account. Its police establishment, municipal law regulations, &c, differ in scarcely any respect from th the metropolis of Eastern India. A few words opoi subject of the state of native education may be added. The advantages of rapid communication between Europe and Asia do not end by merely affording with readim means and appliances for gratifying private tastes, 01 senting materials for agreeable converse. They awaken that powerful, necessary, and mutual interest between the coun tries, which the enormous distance which separai i the olden track seemed to render hopeless. Our men of science in the East are now speedily assisted and encouraged in their labours from home ; and the savans of Euro, structed and delighted with discoveries, the necessary energies required for which being excited and strengthened by a ready correspondence with the learned communities of Bw Our Indian branch societies are thus nourished and protected by the parent roots ; without whose support they must long have languished in their original weaklmg condition. native society is elevating itself, by means of newly-acquired intelligence, to a point which must soon lead to the desirable object of mutual appreciation between European and native talent, and a desire on the part of the most intelligent among the people, that their sons should obtain, by means of an Engsish education, simsiar information to that which, through the medium of unreserved intercourse with us, they discover we possess. The groundwork for so desirable a superstructure ax the perfect civilization of the native gentry, is already laid by the college and schools which have lately been so warmly protected by the general society of Bombay. These institutions (the Elphinstone College and Native Education Society's Schools) are at present the great foun-"], [351, "327 NATIVE EDUCATION. tains from which the blessings of education flow for the people of Western India. The Native Education Society's Schools are situated near the great bazaars, at the extreme end of the esplanade. Committees and examinations are held in the library, a splendid apartment fitted with a good collection of useful works, with globes, maps, and papers, and adorned at either end with full-length portraits of the great benefactors of the institution, Sir John Malcolm, and the Hon. Mountstuart Elphinstone. Many hundreds of boys have been admitted to tbe society's schools, and the branch and infant schools connected with the institution ; the only qualification for admission being a knowledge by the applicant of the vernacular dialect. Eigh teen scholarships, endowed by Lord Clare and Sir Edward West, are in the gift of the society. The regulations require that four endowed scholars should leave the school annuasiy, when two fresh candidates are admitted. Pupils from the schools of Dharwar and Poona are eligible for scholarships, but applications for them are not frequently made. After pubhc examinations, prizes are annually adjudged to the best scholars Gold medals are usually awarded to proficients in the mathematical classes. Modern times hav ing rendered the elements of knowledge, comparatively speaking, very easy of acquirement, it is stsil with unmixed surprise that one first witnesses the kind and degree of in formation possessed by the students of the school. The lads who now form classes in the society's schools are many of them Brahmins by caste ; the descendants of men, whose tenets, resigious and moral, formed the very acme of intolerance, and who would have been considered polluted for days, had the mere shadow of a European fasien across their path. Yet now, a Brahmin youth, still wearing the triple cord, his garments of a fashion simsiar to those worn by his forefathers some centuries since, stands with folded arms, and eyes sparkling with all the eagerness of newly awakened curiosity, to receive instruction from his European master, and become initiated into those mysteries of science of which his fathers dreamt not. Such changes in human feeling, all working to a particular end, as inevitable as the progress of time itself, are curious"], [352, "328 PUBLIC BUILDINGS. and attractive to the intelligent observer, ami few places can afford higher gratification to such, than the examination rooms of the society's schools. A metlical college has been established in Bombay, and proves a magnificent and well-chosen monument to the memory of the late Sir Robert Grant, (formerly a governor of the presidency of Bombay), whose anxiety to ad.iiiu the best interests of the natives of India it is designed to commemorate. The principal public buildings within the town of Bombay are, the Town Hall, the Docks, the Government Hou used as the office of the Secretaries to Government, the two churches before named, the Mint, the Barracks, and the Castle, which contains the Arsenal. All these are upon a large and handsome scale. The rest of the edifices de to public purposes were formerly private dwellings, bin the residences at present in use, they are capacious bui! wanting only the flat roofs, teiraces, and balustrades peculiar to Calcutta, to render them ornamental. The Governor of Bombay, when at the presidency, resides either at Parell, a mansion prettily situated in the midst of gardens four miles from the fort, or at Malabar Point, a bungalow erected upon a rock projecting into the sea at the extreme westerly point of tbe island. The scenery in and about the island of Bombay is ex tremely beautiful, because of the admixture of rice plains, gardens, handsome bungalows, and wooded hills, with occa sional peeps of the sea-shore, and the open main or land-locked hays. An exception must be taken to the village of Girgaum, which is densely planted with cocoa-nut groves. The climate of Bombay is, perhaps, superior in point of salubrity to that of Bengal ; but the cold season scarcely merits the name, for there is nothing like the bracing weather experienced at the same period of the year in the neighbouring presidency. One peculiarity of Bombay consists in the wind blowing hot and cold at the same time, an alternation attended with tl inconvenience of afflicting with temporary rheumatism those persons who, being sightly clad to resist the one, are suddenly assailed by the other. Tbe year may be said to be divided hi to three seasons. The hot season is from February to May, during which the"], [353, "329 CLIMATE SEASONS \u2014 POPULATION. thermometer ranges from 80\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. Early in June the south-west monsoon commences, and continues till the full moon in October or early in November, during which period the rain falls with scarcely any intermission for several days, attended by a few days of fine weather. In October the wind shifts to the north-east. Cool land-winds now prevail till February, during the nights, but change to strong sea. breezes at noon. In March and April the weather becomes sultry and close, only relieved by occasional thunder-storms of brief duration. During the rainy season the thermometer falls to 70\u00b0, rarely rising to 80\u00b0. In December and January, when the land wind prevails, it falls to 65\u00b0. The population of Bombay is computed at 400,000 souls, about 1,000 of whom are European and East-Indian resi dents. The merchants, traders, shopkeepers, are English, Portu guese, Armenians, Jews, Arabs, Moguls, Hindoos, and Parsees. There are also several brokers, auctioneers and wine mer chants, shopkeepers and wine dealers, booksellers, bakers, horse-brokers, and apothecaries and druggists. The rest of the trades are distributed amongst an infinite number of very small establishments. The European and Parsee community of the Western Presidency have done much for the civilization of the place, and the advancement of great objects, independently of the formation of the educational institutions alluded to above. There is an excellent club (at Byculla, a msie or two from the fort), corresponding in character with that of Calcutta ; a branch of the Asiatic Society, with a capital library and museum ; two banks, several Insurance Societies, a Chamber of Commerce, a Medical and Physical Society, an Agricul tural and Horticultural Association, a Geographical Society, an Exchange Room, a Benevolent Society, several Bible Auxiliary and other Resigious Institutions, a Sailors' Home, a magnificent hospital, called the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, a Dharamsala (a species of caravanserai, built by Sir Jamset jee) &c. The manufactures of Bombay, which, as we have elsewhere said, is rather an emporium for the products of other coun tries than fruitful in itself, are very few in number. Per haps the most remarkable offspring of the ingenuity of its"], [354, "330 MOSAIC WORK. inhabitants are the inlaid or Mosaic work-boxes, card-cases, writing-desks, &c. The Mosaic is sometimes used as a sort of veneer over thi whole surface of an article, and at others, simply as an inlaid bordering on cedar or ivory, being frequently enrit -i the addition of silver to the varied and beautiful colours which compose the Mosaic. This art is of Sindh now, however, exercised to a veiy considerable ext.

Small rods of variously-stained ivory are first dipped colourless glue, and then placed horizontally between the planes, with such arrangements as shall hereafter sot desired pattern. The whole is submitted to heavy pr untsi perfectly dry. Bordering being required, the ivory cutter severs from either end of the prepared planes a por tion of about half a quarter of an inch thick, when the most perfect pattern of Mosaic bordering is obtained. By this ingenious method, two six-inch planes of ivory will afford patterns for a considerable number of pretty articles, which are sold at a third of the price which would be required, were each strip of the Mosaic bordering arranged expi for the purpose. The value of a handsome desk or work box of the Bombay work is about six guineas, but au orna mented watch-stand or card-case may be obtained lora few shsilings. Mention has elsewhere been made of the holiday ogrement of Bombay, the chief of which are a trip to the island of Elephanta and to Gora Bunder. Of the remarkable features of the former, its cavern temples, particular mention is made in Moor's Pantheon. They are curious works of art, but are now falling rapidly to decay. The Gora Bunder river flows between lofty hsils, beauti fully wooded, and studded here and there with antique ruins, and huge masses of dark rock, which, fringed with luxuriant creepers, start from amid the rich and glossy underwood, while the graceful bamboo, crowned with tasselled creepers, form vegetating arches of brsisiant blossoms, decorating the"], [355, "331 GORA BUNDER AND BASSEIN. river's banks. Above the landing-place, embedded among the summits of luxuriant and lofty trees, is an age-stained and many-turretted monastery, at the foot of which, reached by a narrow, wooded, and rocky pass, it is customary for the picnic visitor to pitch a tent. A double- poled tent forms a commodious dining-room ; the marching cots are placed in a smaller one beyond it, while the humble bechoba* is laid out with bath and tosiette table ; and the attendant servants, in a routie* apart, make the necessaiy preparations for the approaching meal. The doors of the large tents open into each other ; carpets spread over the wesi-swept ground give an air of comfort to the whole ; and green checks, suspended to the outer door, shade from the eye the glare of the neigh bouring sosi. The Portuguese monastery of Gora Bunder has been fitted with a Mahomedan dome. It contains several excellent apartments, lighted by large windows, barred with wood, and commanding magnificent views of the surrounding scenery. On one side may be observed the picturesque windings of the beautiful and placid river, its rocks, and trees, and moun tain scenery ; while on the other, a wide plain, covered with fine plantations of rice and sugar-cane, stretches away to a considerable distance, where the river, forming a natural boundary on the one side, on the other washes the extensive walls of the city of Bassein. A Parsee tower, and trifling ruins of cloistered avenues, are scattered about the uneven ground on which the monastery stands. The city of Bassein has been long forsaken ; a few fisher men and shikarries alone occupy a spot once replete with luxury and power, and still containing magnificent evidences of taste, in the application of great and national wealth. The market-place, cloisters, and churches, are in a state of ruin and desolation, embedded in rich verdure, and garlanded with parasitical plants, hastening their decay. The city contains about eight churches, of considerable size anti great architectural beauty ; their square towers and ruined gasieries surmount the dense masses of foliage which shade the lower portions of the busidings, and from every * Bechoba, a small sleeping tent. t Rautie, a small low tent, similar to those used by private soldiers."], [356, "332 RUINS OP BASSEIN. point of view wliich the traveller can select, present ex(] studies for graphic delineation.

Connected with Bombay by another causeway, at the south-westerly corner of the island, is the smaller island of Colaba, where there is a gun-carriage manufactory, an obser vatory, a lighthouse, and barracks for a regiment of infantry. Here also is a church busit to commemorate the officers kisied in Affghanistan. The territory subject to the authority of the Bombay government comprises in the south (as far as Goa, the last remnant of the Portuguese territories), Dapoolee, Severn droog, Rutnagherry, Malwan, Vingorla (all reduced fortresses in the Southern Concan), to Belgaum in the east ; and in the north, Surat, Broach, Baroda, Kaira, and Ahmedabad, in Guzerat, as far as Palunpore, on the southern border of the Shekawuttee territory. Baroda is under the Guicowar, a native prince, long on a friendly footing with the British Government, at whose court we have a resident and a subsi diary force. East of Palunpore, distant about one hundred msies, sies Neemuch, tbe most westerly cantonment jbelong ing to the Supreme Government, and occupied by Bengal troops. West of Baroda is the peninsula of Kattewar, where a political agent resides, with a smasi body of troops at his bidding, in the central cantonment of Raj cote.

Separated from Kattewar by a gulf is the Rum. territory of Cutch, bordering upon Scinde. Cu tch, go\\ by a Rao, who is supreme in his own territory, has loip. tributary to the British authority, which has retained a red* dent and a proportion of troops at Bhooj. Its chief i tance, as a friendly state, has arisen from the circumstance of its having formed a species of barrier between our possessions in Western India and the territory of Scinde. The latter exists now as a portion of the British empire, won by the sword, and maintained at a terrible cost of life, through sickness among the troops who occupy the principal si of Hyderabad, Sukkur, Shikarpore, &c. The principal stations in the Bombay Presidency are Poona, Sattarah, Belgaum, Malligaum (Kandeish), Al nuggur, in the Deccan ; Surat, Baroda, Ahmedabad, Kaira, Rajcote and Deesa, in Guzerat ; Booj in Cutch ; Hyderabad) Kurrachee, Sukkur, and Shikarpore, in Scinde. Tho. e stations which he to the east, north-east, or south-east of Bombay, are connected with the presidency by good roads ; in pro ceeding thither, therefore, the travesier has the choice of marching or going by dawk. With the north and south stations the communication is generally by water, in ste;. pattamars, or occasional ships. Poona is at once the nearest and the largest military station. It is distant ninety-eight msies from Bombay, and is reached by boat and dawk, or boats and mail carriage. A boat carries you across the harbour of Bombay to Panwell, the nearest tillage on the continent. The travesier thence commences his journey to Poona. The first stage to Khalapoor over a lovely country, is only interesting to the stranger from its contrast with the crowded city aspect of Bombay. The alternation of jungle with paddy (rice) fields and poor but picturesque villages constitutes the main features of the scenery for the first eighteen miles; but when at Khalapoor, the foot of the ghaut, or mountain, is reached, the sublime begins to take precedence of the beautiful. It is advisable, if travelling in the cool season,"], [359, "335 BOMBAY TO POONA. from October to March, to leave Panwesi at about three in the morniug, for the first stage is then accomplished by eight A. m., and the ascent of the ghaut can be commenced at an hour when the magnificence of the scenery can be contem plated to advantage. The varied foliage which covers the mountain's sides ; the deep, rocky ravines ; the lofty ascent by a well-constructed road ; the occasional rencontre of the laden elephant and burthened camel ; the song of birds ; the costumes of the native pedestrian traveller, or the equip ment of the wealthier merchant, squatted in his singularly constructed car ; the pensioned or tributary Mahratta chief tain, with his httle band of retainers, bristling with arms, constitute a varied picture which pleasantly beguiles the way farer of his fatigue. At Karlee, at the top of the ghaut, one-half of the journey to Poona has been accompsished, and here it may be as well to halt and take breakfast. The bungalow, or resting-house, at Karlee is advantageously situ ated, commanding a superb view of a part of the western ghauts on the one side, and of the table-land to the east ward. There is a remarkable cavern in the vicinity of Kar lee, hewn on the face of a precipice, about two-thirds up the sides of a steep hsil, rising, with a very scarped and regular talus, to the height of about 800 feet above the level of the plain. The excavations consist of a temple, and many smaller apartments and galleries, in two stories, some of them beautifusiy ornamented. A ruinous temple of Siva serves as a gateway to the gore. A singular busiding stands on the right hand of its portico. Within the portico are colossal figures, in alto-resievo, of elephants bestridden by mahouts, and mounted with howdahs. There are many columns within the cave, with capitals resembhng bulls, and surmounted each by two elephants. Tulligaon, and the country on either side, are next passed during the night ; but it may be as well to mention, for the guidance of those who may prefer travelling in the day time, that excepting an occasional temple, a tank constructed by devotees, there is not a single object worthy of particular inspection. The road lies through a gently-undulating country, extensively cultivated, and the atmosphere is won derfully clear and pure, by reason of the elevation of tbe land. At Tulligaon there is a bungalow corresponding in"], [360, "336 HOG-HUNTING. all respects with the one at Karlee. We reach Poona at the end of a nine hours' journey, and proceed at once to the dawk bungalow, or to the residence of any one to letters of introduction may have been previously sent. Poona, once the capital of the dominions of the Peishwa, is one of the largest military stations in India. There are seldom less than six or seven infantry regiments can there, with a brigade of horse artsilery. At the dist.. five or six miles from Poona is Kirkee, where arc barracks for a regiment of British dragoons. The governor of Bom bay frequently resides at Poona during the summer i at a place in the neighbourhood, casied Dapooree, where there is a botanic garden. The description given of the Cawnpore cantonment, in a former part of this work, s l with little variation, to that of Poona, the only difference being that the climate of the Deccan is more salubrious than that of Cawnpore, the scenery more attractive, the dust of the station less offensive, and the buildings less scattered. Poona, was, at the early period of the British possession of the country, most famous for field sports. The w il I familiarly called the hog, was then so common, that whole sounders have been known to dash through the camp i day. The clearing away of jungle, the occupation of a large extent of land, and the great industry of our Nimrods, have now thinned the vicinage of the station of its ancient wild inhabitants ; but the Deccan is still very celebrated as a sport ing country, and affords the resident many an opportunity of whiling away leisure in an exciting and noble pastime. The hog is pursued in India in a much more manly way than in any other country in the world. Disdaining the aid of dogs and the use of fire-arms, the Indian hog-hunter saddles his httle Arab, aud, vaulting into his seat, spear in hand, rides to the cover with a few companions, all equally eager for the honour of inflicting tbe first wound. Sometimes native rustics are employed to beat the jungle, the sugar cane plantations, or other haunt of the grisly boar, and drive him into the plain ; but in some places this process is unnecessary, as \" the pigs\" come out of their own accord, to take the air or wallow in some neighbouring jh eel. The moment they are seen, the hunters make for them at a killing pace. Away goes the boar, over rocky ground, swamps,"], [361, "337 THE C0RYGAUM OR KORIGAON PILLAR. nusiahs, and jungles. The chase is prolonged, over a wide extent of country, for half an hour or more : sometimes the boar gets away ; sometimes, driven to his last shifts, he turns about and gallantly charges his foes. Then comes the criti- cal moment. If the Arab swerves, or the spear is untrue, a fearful gash in the belly or a leg of the horse assures the boar escape, at least from one opponent ; if otherwise \u2014 if the horse obeys the bridle, maintains his stand, and enables the huntsman to desiver his spear just above the shoulder of the boar, the grey monster dies, and while his tusks adorn the tent or bungalow of the victor, his fat sides furnish forth a repast with which domestic pork-chops will bear no kind of comparison. In some parts of India our sportsmen throw the spear \u2014 in others they thrust or job it. Controversies upon the relative merits of these systems were rife in the Bombay and Bengal Sporting Magazines ; but it is difficult to say which plan is admitted to be the most efficacious. Midway between Poonah and Seroor stands the Corygaum monument, erected to the memory of the officers and men who fesi in one of the most remarkable conflicts on record, during the last Mahratta war. Mr. Horace Wilson thus tells the story. \u2014 \" Tbe detachment left Seroor on the 31st of December, 1818, at six in the evening, and by ten on the following morning, had ascended some high ground about half way to Poona, overlooking the vsilage of Korigaon, and the adjacent plains watered by the Bheema river. Beyond the river appeared the whole of the Peishwa's forces, estimated at 20,000 horse and 8,000 foot. Captain Staunton immediately determined to throw himself into Korigaon, which being surrounded by a wall, and protected on the south by the bed of the river, offered shelter against the Mahratta cavalry, and might enable him to resist any force of infantry that could be brought against him. As soon as his movement, was descried, his intention was anticipated by the enemy, and a numerous body of their infantry, chiefly Arabs, pushed for the same point. Both parties reached the place nearly at the same time, and each occupied a part of the village, the British the northern and western, the Arabs the southern and eastern portions. The Arabs obtained possession of a smasi fort, which gave them the advantage ; but good positions were secured for the z"], [362, "338 BATTLE OF CORYGAUM. guns, one commanding the principal street, the other tin banks of the river. By noon the preparations of both par ties were complete, and a desperate, and seeiniiu.- 1 struggle ensued. The first efforts of the Brit i to dislodge the enemy from that portion of the . isiage which they had seized ; but their superior numbers enabled them to repel the several vigorous assaults made for that pu and Captain Staunton was obliged to confine his obji the defence of his own position. The Arab infai,: in their turn the assasiants, and while some maintui galling fire from the fort, and the terraced roofs of the houses, others rushed along the passages between the walls surrounding them, leading to the British posts, win resolution. They were torn to pieces by the discharge from the guns, which were served with equal rapid! I , cision, or they were encountered and driven back at the point of the bayonet by the equal resolution of the defenders. In these actions, the few officers commanding the troopt necessarily exposed to more than ordinary hazard. were eight in number, including two assistant surgeon^ were more usefully employed encouraging the soldiers, than in attendance on the wounded, and who shared with their brother officers the peril and honours of the day. In addition to the dangers and trials of the engagement, the men much distressed by want of food and water, and by the fatigues of their previous march. Towards evenin : situation of the party became critical. Lieutenant Chi of the artisiery, was killed ; many of the artillerymen were killed or disabled ; Lieutenants Pattinson, Conellan, and Swanston, and Assistant-surgeon Wingate, had been won and Captain Staunton, with Lieutenant Innes, and Asm surgeon Wylie, were the only officers remaining effective. At this time one of the guns was captured, and the enemy penetrated to a Choultry, a building for travellers, in which many of the wounded had been deposited. The ferocity of the assailants vented itself upon the helpless men who were thus within reach, and many of them were barbarously slain. Amongst them, Mr. Wingate was cut to pieces, and Lieu tenants Swanston and Conellan were about to share the same fate when the surviving officers, at the head of a party of their men, charged into the Choultry, bayoneted ever"], [363, "339 TRIUMPH OF STAUNTON. of the enemy who was found within it, and put those with out to flight. Tbe gun was recovered by a sally, headed by Lieutenant Pattin son, although at the time mortally wounded. A second wound disabled him ; but his example had been nobly followed, and the Arabs were driven back with great slaughter. Notwithstanding their success, the loss had been so great, and the exhaustion of the troops was so excessive, that some of the men, both Europeans and natives, began to consider resistance hopeless, and expressed a desire to apply for terms of surrender. \" Their commanding officer, however, convinced them their only hope of safety lay in a protracted defence, and that to surrender would doom them to certain destruction from barbarous foes, exasperated by the loss wlsich they had suffered. This exhortation animated the troops to persevere, and the Arabs, disheartened by the isi success of their re peated assaults, intermitted their exertions, and about nine drew off, leaving the entire village in possession of the de tachment. \" During the night water was procured, and arrangements were made for the renewal of the defence. But the Peishwa, learning that General Smith was approaching, considered further delay unsafe, and at daylight of the 2nd of January, his whole force was in motion along the Poona road. Not being aware of the advance of the fourth division, Captain Staunton thought it advisable to march back to Seroor. The enemy attempted to entice him to cross the river into the more open country, by sending fictitious messages from Poona, urging him to hasten his march in that direction, and he pretended to entertain the purpose of complying with the request. Towards nightfall, however, having pro cured conveyance for his wounded, he set off for Seroor, which he entered the following morning, with both his guns, and all his wounded, with drums beating, and colours flying ; thus having set a memorable example of what is possible to a resolute spirit, and of the wisdom of resistance in the most desperate circumstances.\" Leaving Poona, the road runs south-easterly to Sholapoke, nine stages, averaging sixteen msies each, through a fertile, welf-governed country.

North-west of Bombay are the gulfs of Cambay and of Cutch, and between them, on the Guzerat peninsula, are the stations of Rajcote and Deesa \u2014 the former in the centre of the peninsula, and the latter more to the north and east, on the lest bank of the river Bunnass, which falls into the gulf of Cutch. Deesa is the most advanced misitary station on"], [365, "341 mount aboo. the Guzerat frontier. It is a dry, hot, intensely arid place. The sun comes down \" in right earnest upon the waste, and there is need,\" says Lieut. Eastwick, \" of many a fold of twisted muslin round the white topee to keep off his impor tunity.\" The sosi is 'of fine, warm sand, into which you sink at every step. Yet there is a charm in the place for the lovers of sport. The spur, and the spear, and the deadly grooved rifle are never idle. Lions as well as tigers abound in the jungle on the banks of the Banass. It is rare that these beasts are harboured together, but here, assuredly, is an exception to the rule. Mount Aboo, a detached mountain of the Aravuli range, is situated forty miles north-east from Deesa. It towers over the neighbouring mountains, like a tall leader in the front of his line. It is worth the ascent, which has been of late years frequently made. The height is about 4,000 feet, and the summit is reached only with a great effort, for the sides are craggy and precipitous. Most travellers who bave tried to reach it on foot have been beaten, and only too glad to avasi themselves of the assistance of the Bheels, and their bamboo chairs. Once on the mountain's brow, and the tosi of ascent is fairly recompensed. \" I can imagine,\" writes a recent travesier, \" no scene more beautiful. The far view over the unbroken plain beneath ; the fantastic rocks around crowned and clustered over with the rarest plants and flowers ; the strange white temples with their grotesque figures and quaint embellishments ; the clear, peaceful lake, over which nods many a drowsy pinnacle, hallowed by Hindoo legend, \u2014 these are things to be gazed on \u2014 not described.\" Aboo has been from ancient times a place of pilgrimage to the Hindoos. Its natural advantages, and tbe remarkable beauty of its scenery, must have recommended it from the earliest ages to a religion which delights to sacrifice on the mountains, and to hasiow any lake or stream. The highest peak is called Gooroosikur, or the \" Saints' Pinnacle,\" because certain saints in the Hindoo mythology are said to have made the summit their abode. Tbe temples adorning Aboo have been built within the last few centuries, by the Jains. They are of white marble, ornamented with innumerable figures and the richest tracery. The range of the thermo meter at Aboo in the hottest months in the year is"], [366, "342 CUTCH AND SCINDE. fifteen degrees below the ordinary range on the phras (jj its immediate vicinity, and as winds are cons! an the climate is altogether more fat ourable to a European constitution. West of Guzerat, across the Runn, we enter the sandy province of Cutch, which is bounded on the north by Ajmere on the south by the sea, and on the west by the Indus. Tie Runn is an immense morass, covering 8,000 square miles \u2014 the rest of the province consists of an irregular hilly tract. The whole face of the country near the hills is covered with volcanic matter. The province is not fertile \u2014 wh' scarce and brackish. The chief production of Cui cotton. Iron, alum, and coal are also found. The inhabi tants are chiefly Jahrajahs of Scinde origin, the most de graded of the natives of India. The pilots and mariners, however, are noted for their skill, and something is do the coast in the way of ship-busiding. The chief towns in Cutch are Booj and Maudavie. Scinde is portioned off into three divisions, or districts, \u2014 Kurrachee, Hydrabad, and Shikaqjore. The first mentioned is the favourite station, and certainly has the advanl the sea air ; but it is doubtful whether this is not con balanced by the scarcity of good fresh water, which ever be experienced near the coast. This is more particularly felt if large numbers of troops are located on the spot. For a small civil station it is particularly adapted, but it is not a good site for the head-quarters of the province, firon being central. The buildings erected for the accommodation of the civsi and msiitary branches of the service are very numerous, and though a few good houses may be seen here and there, generally speaking they fall short of what are to be seen in other stations in India. The barracks are hand some buildings, and well situated ; but the greatest ornament to the station is its Horticultural Garden, which does great credit to those who have taken so much trouble and care in bringing it to perfection. The right bank of the Indns forms the principal boundary sine of the district, to a tew miles above Sehwan. Hydrabad is a cosiectorate, or Sudder station. The city is large, and on a hisi immediately to the north of the fort When the filthy state of the town is taken into account, it"], [367, "343 SCINDE. may be considered tolerably salubrious. The Hydrabad dis trict includes all land between the left bank of the Indus and the desert, and northward as far as where the territories ceded to Asi Morad commence. Shikarpore is the remaining civil station. Some of the gardens in its neighbourhood are well laid out, and though far from an enviable place, stisi, compared with Sukkur, the military station, it may be looked upon as a paradise. The district extends northward to tbe boundaries of the foreign states both on the right and left bank of the Indus. These several stations have more or less troops, with the usual staff ; and also a collector of revenue, with one or two deputies, a superintendent of pohce, and a wesi-organized police force, both horse and foot. Several deputy collectors are in the interior stationed from thirty to fifty msies apart, who also act as magistrates. The sosi near the banks of the river is in many places of a loose sandy description ; but where this does not form the principal characteristic, it consists of a fine loamy rich clay, exceedingly fertile ; large tracts of land are impregnated with nitre, and of course valueless for agricultural purposes. The hisis are composed of sandstone, and therefore barren ; stisi in the distance they form a pleasing background to the view, and a relief to the eye. Some of the limestone occa sionally met with, is of a variegated nature \u2014 red and green hues. Numerous fossil sea shells have been discovered in these hisis, full 200 miles from the sea. Irrigation is principally effected by river and canal water ; wells are very seldom resorted to. During the height of the flow of water, which lasts about two months, httle or no exer tion is necessary for leading them to any approximate land. At other times the Persian wheels are used ; these are of a most deplorably clumsy construction, generasiy worked by a camel, whose tall ungainly form looks most miserable, and even ludicrous, when harnessed to tbe apparatus blindfolded, and stalking round and round all day ; the trough that receives the water from the pots on the wheel is so badly formed, that full a moiety returns from whence it came, thus causing double labour. When the river gets very low, and the waters have to be raised fifty or 100 feet, it is usual to have a reservoir midway ; and in that case two wheels and"], [368, "344 PRODUCTIONS AND REVENUE. a double set of camels, or cattle, are required to bring the water to the desired level. Canals are constructed in every possible direction, but though necessary, they are thi ef constant expense and vexation. The canal- clearing is the annual harvest-home to numerous people, who r large advances for dealing the canals of the sand, Ac, > settle in the beds during the past inundation. It is usual with tbe parties thus engaged to put off all debts and difficulties till this period, when they are liquidated iustanter, from the advances received from government. The cultivation in Lower Scinde consists of Joar (Holcus Sorgum) and Bajree (//. spicatus) and Dbau. This haivest, which is principally depended upon, is gathered in Den and January. Dhan proves highly productive on well flooded lands, where the river has risen tq its full he but in some seasons this crop fails, and cannot be depended on, as wesi as the first-mentioned grains, which are prodi by artificial irrigation. The sugar-cane thrives well in many parts of Lower Scinde, is capable of vast improvement; and might be greatly extended. Indian corn, sweet potato (Convolvulus batatas) and various other nutritious productions thrive well, but the cultivation is very limited indeed, scarcely sufficient for local consump tion. In Upper Scinde, wheat, barley, and gram are grains under cultivation, and any excess of produce fii. way by easy transit to Lower Scinde, where it is retailed to great advantage, and at a high price. The Jageer lands are far more extensive in Lower than in Upper Scinde. They comprise more than a fourth of the territories attached to the British rule. It was a wise policy, and certainly a just one, of Sir Charles Napier, to restore to the Jageerdars their rent-free lands. When lapses by death take place in any of the Jageerdars who have been confirmed in their Jageers by the English government, a fourth of the value or produce of the said rent-free lands, namely, the Jageerdar's share, is to revert to government This is a fair provision, as it does not affect the incumbents, and may be looked upon in the light of tribute. These parties have undisputed and quiet possession of their lands, and where they derive water for irrigation from canals formed at the expense of government, there they are called"], [369, "345 POPULATION MANN ERS. upon to pay a certain sum as their share for the benefits derived. The waste lands are very extensive, principally situated in unfavourable localities for irrigation. Such tracts as are impregnated with carbonate of soda, nitre, and muriate of soda, are of course utterly unproductive, and the extent of such tracts is very great ; the waste lands first mentioned are not however completely useless, as the shrubs and jungle found on them serve to feed large herds of camels and cattle. Population. \u2014 The Mussulman sect predominates over the Hindoo, it is said, by three to two. The Scindians are, generally speaking, strong and hardy, many of them tall, with dark complexions. Those who are in comfortable circumstances, and not exposed, are however very fair. This is particularly the case with the women, who are secluded, and may correctly be termed of the fair caste. Very few Rajpoots, Brahmins, or ladies are to be seen. Meat and wine do not come amiss to them. They are a very industrious set, and the most wealthy as the natural conse quence. All are addicted to smoking to an alarming extent : a hookah, peculiar to this part of India, is in use ; the hookah bottom is of earthenware \u2014 very large, to which a nearly horizontal snake is attached, so adjusted as to enable the smoker to sit at his ease on the floor, and continue his work, smoking at the same time ; the snakes are often four or five feet in length. They smoke tobacco, as also ganjah (Cannabis Iiidica), to a great extent, supplied from Candahar, Cabul, and the countries between the Indus and Herat. They use and smoke it the same way as the\" Egyptians. The dress of the people is unsike that of any other part of India. Their caps are extremely fanciful and pretty, but give no shade to the face ; they are made of quilted cloth, and of all the colours of the rainbow ; some are worked in with gold and ssiver thread. The turbans worn by the Hindoos are of an immense magnitude, and it puzzles the beholder to know how they can be made ; these turbans are the repositories of any valuable documents they may possess, as well as jewels, or other light property. Nearly all, whether Mussulmans or Hindoos, wear beards, which they often dye of a red colour. The women are also"], [370, "346 CUSTOMS CLIMATE. fond of dyeing the hair. The better class of Scini a long shirt, of fine or coarse cloth, agreeable to the circom stances of the wearer, which reaches nearly to the i and is uncoufined by any waistband \u2014 also loot underneath. All tbe poor and working classes ha. mous quantity of superfluous clothes mi, gen and they wear them round the waist. Indeed, so are they, that had they been inhabitants of a cold i they could not have required more clothing than is now resorted to. The better class of females follow the practice of the Egyptian women, and when walking abroad are covered with an immense piece of cloth in the si extinguisher, which is gathered together on the crown - head, reaching to the soles of the feet, having small i holes perforated in front, before the eyes, to enable th see their way ; these envelopes are of white cloth, an wearers look like so many walking ghosts. The popul suffers greatly occasionally from epidemic disorders, us case in all parts of India, and therefore must bc calculated upon accordingly. Climate. \u2014 So much prejudice exists in disfavour of the climate of Scinde, that any individual attempting to in its favour has a fair chance of not being credited. I country we have seen as many sturdy, old, grey-headed men in the villages, as are to be met with in any portion of the Company's dominions. Some of the staff, and others, have resided in the province from three to seven years, ami as good health as they could have done had they been in any favoured station attached to the Bombay Presidency. In a good house, well secured by glazed doors and windows, and with a single tatee, the temperature during May am! will not exceed 83\u00b0, and without the latter, 86 Good houses are, however, rare. A few are to be found at Kurrachee, one at Hydrabad, and one or two at Sukkur. During all the hot season, that is, from the 15th of April to the end of November, such an occurrence as a hot night is seldom known ; on the contrary, the nights are cold, and officers, living in well-situated localities, find it necessary to use more covering at night than they would think it expe dient to require in England in the summer months. From October to the middle of April the weather is charmingly"], [371, "347 CLIMATE SCENERY. pleasant, aud from the middle of November to the same period in February the cold is intense, morning and evening, for India. The extreme heat complained of at Sukkur, can be accounted for by the position of the cantonments. AU the barracks and officers' houses are situated on barren calca reous formations \u2014 they can hardly be designated hills ; these rocks become so hot at mid-day that none can walk on them barefooted with impunity. The heat is retained, more or less, the whole night ; and the place never becomes cool, except for the few months of cold weather. It is not just to judge of the whole province from a residence at this awful station. A far more pleasant and agreeable locasity could have been selected for a misitary station a few msies lower down the stream, where the banks of the river are very high and firm, and the scenery romantically pretty, with tbe advantage of being 10\u00b0 or 15\u00b0 cooler. The dust that prevails in Scinde is, perhaps, more distressing than any degree of heat. But, by artificial contrivances, and some expense, the European resident is not inconvenienced. Dust equasiy prevails in many of the military stations in the North- Western Provinces, particularly those on the banks of the Sutledge ; but houses with every convenience and com fort have been constructed, at any expense, at those stations, to insure comfort from the external enemies, heat and dust. Scenery.\u2014 The traveller who only penetrates a few miles on either side of the Indus would pronounce Scinde a sterile country, and devoid of asi picturesque beauties. Such, how ever, is not the case, and though not very rich in forest scenery, still, very handsome groves of trees are to be met with. Some of the views on the banks of the small winding tributary rivers \u2014 more particularly at the season of the in undation \u2014 are charming to the eye ; the foliage of the trees along the banks being rich in the extreme. In the neigh bourhood of Hydrabad, for many miles along the winding Fullasiee, this is the case. The river view of Sukkur, Buk kur, and Roree, with the Rocky Island, is also exceedingly imposing as you approach from the south.

With the exception of the direct road from the city of Hydrabad to Roree, there is nothing worthy of the name in Scinde. Wheeled carriage is unknown : indeed the face of the country is so cut up by canals and watercourses, that no wheeled conveyances could be used.

We have mentioned, in connection with our sketch of Calcutta, the Sanitaria at Darjeeling and the Cossyah Hills. Bombay, too, has its Sanitarium \u2014 the Mahabaleshwur Hisis, which are situated 17\u00b0 56' north latitude, and in longitude 73\u00b0 30' east, and are distant twenty-five msies due east from the sea, and sixty-nine msies from Bombay, which bears north 29\u00b0 west. They form a portion of the extensive chain of mountains known under the name of the Western Ghats, or Syhadree mountains. On their western side they rise with an abrupt and precipitous ascent from the Concan, which separates them from the sea, while their eastern face presents a somewhat less rapid and steep descent into the table-land of the Deccan. The general elevation of the station is 4,500 feet above the level of the sea, while its highest summit attains an alti tude of 4,700 feet. It is elevated upwards of 4,000 feet above the subjacent country on the Concan side, and about 2,300 feet above the general level of the Deccan at its eastern base. Its greatest breadth at the northern extremity is about fifteen msies, and about eight at its southern boun dary. The average direct length north and south does not exceed five miles, though from north-east to south-west it extends diagonally seventeen msies. Excellent roads have been made in almost every direction. These already extend over a space of upwards of forty msies, more than one-half of which are carriage-roads, and the remainder bridle-paths, and have been so laid out as to open up to the visitor a varied succession of mountain scenery, which, for grandeur and beauty, it is besieved, can be equasied in few parts of the world. The sosi consists principally of a red clay (formed by the disintegration of cellular ferruginous clay-stone, which con stitutes the surface rock), intermixed with the debris of trap-"], [374, "350 MALCOLM PETH. rock, and in many places with a considerable decayed vegetable matter, forming a brown mould, which is found to be very productive. An abundant supply of lent water is at all seasons procurable, either from wells, which vary from twenty to forty feet in depth, or from tlm small streamlets which traverse the hills, some of retain their water during the whole of the hot season extensive artificial lake, which is now being constructed, will add materially to the supply of water already avm whether for cultivation or for domestic use.

Potatoes of excesient quasity are cultivated very exten sively, both for the consumption of the station and fl supply of the Bombay and Poona markets. A plentiful supply of all the common culinary vegetables of the best description can be procured at reasonable rates. The exces sive heaviness of the rains prevents the successful cultivation of European fruits. The vsilage of Malcolm Peth (so named by the Rajah of Sattara in honour of the late Sir John Malcolm, the d guished founder of the station) contains several Eu> shops, where European supplies of almost every description are procurable at the same rates as at Poona, and very little higher than at Bombay. The station is also visit numerous itinerant hawkers (Borahs) from Bon.- Malcolm Peth Bazaar is a tolerably large one, and supplied with asi articles of consumption, which are ti. tluce of the country, and generally at moderate rates. mutton, which is small, but of excellent quality, is sold at one and a half annas per pound ; beef at one auna per pound ; fowLs at three or four annas each.

A monthly nerrik, or price current, is circulated for the information of visitors ; but, under existing regulations, its observance cannot be enforced on the dealers, though they almost invariably conform to it. Mahabaleshwur is easily accessible both from Bombay and from the principal stations of the Deccan and Concan. The visitor from Bombay, by sasiing down the coast to Bancoote, and thence up the Sa wi tree river to Mhar (a distance of seventy msies by sea and thirty by river), is brought within twenty-seven miles land journey from the hsils ; or, should he object to even tins short sea-trip, he can cross the harbour to Nagotna (which is effected in one tide), from which the distance by land is only seventy msies, along an excellent road, with a public bungalow at each stage. The distance from Poona, by an indifferent hsily route, is seventy msies, and from Sattara only thirty msies, by a very good carriage road. The approach, both from the Concan and from the Deccan side, is at asi times safe, as there is no intervening jungle, and no danger to be apprehended from attacks of fever or other diseases of malarious origin. This station was ceded to the British Government, by the Rajah of Sattara, in exchange for another vsilage, and was annexed to the Zillah of the Concan. The pubsic busidings consist of a sanatarium, containing eight sets of quarters, and five detached bungalows, for the accommodation of sick officers and their families ; a church, which was busit by private subscription, and accommodates 180 people; a small subsidiary gaol, containing sixty Chi nese convicts, who are employed in the construction and repair of roads, a chowrie, and a Dhurumsallah for native travellers. There is a subscription library, containing many hundred volumes, and a hotel, on a very smasi scale, has recently been completed. The private dwelling-houses are seventy in number ; of which fifty-three are substantially built of hewn stone and sime, and the remainder of rough stone and mortar, sun-dried bricks, or wattle-work. The greater number of them are thatched, tsies having been found not to resist the monsoon rain.

In addition to the effects which usually result from a change from a warm to a cold clin latitudes and to all elevations, an improvement of th. tite, and of the digestive and of assimilative functions an increase of muscular and mental energy, there are experienced, in greater or less degree, at this stat peculiar feeling of excitement, and a sense of dryne constriction of the skin, wiiich appear to be solely attribut- able to the effect of diminished atmospheric pressure, in exciting the circulating system, and in augm* cutaneous evaporation. It is the presence of this element in the constitution of inter-tropical mountain climates which emphatically distinguishes them from all other climates whose temperature is the effect of la! and wiiich will ever render them inferior in theraj efficacy. The climate of this station is inapplicable, if not posi injurious, in all acute inflammatory affections, and in the greater number of organic visceral diseases. On the other hand, it has been found beneficial in uncomplicated inter mittent fevers ; in the greater number of functional disorders"], [377, "353 ITS EFFECT ON HEALTH. of the digestive organs ; in general debility ; cachexia ; and impaired general health (unaccompanied by local disease), whether the result of long-continued exposure to a tropical climate, or of close application to official duty, and the sedentary life which usually accompanies it, or of tedious convalescence from acute disease.

The agency of this climate in the preservation of health, and prevention of disease, is probably greater and more beneficial than its direct therapeutic efficacy, more particu larly in relation to females and children. The practice, which is now so prevalent in the Bombay presidency, of withdraw ing children from the pernicious influence of the excessive heat of the low country during the hot season, and of trans ferring them, during these months, to this temperate and equable climate, has the incalculably beneficial effect of warding off many of the acute attacks incident to childhood, and more especiasiy to the period of dentition ; of support ing the energies of their constitution on a nearer level with the European standard during the first years of their growth, when such constitutional invigoration is of vital importance ; and of lessening the hability to future disease and future delicacy of constitution, to which all children, born and reared for some years in India, are more or less liable. 2 A"], [378, "354 THE EASTERN ISLANDS AND MALAYAN PENI> The islands and places belonging to the East India Com pany, and over which the Crown exercises dominion, are Penang, Malacca, and Singapore.

The former consists of two rar unequal height and length, which run north and The principal or west range stretches from one end of the island to the other, but has a deep notch running across it, which separates the range into nearly two equal | western range is lofty, rising out of the sea at it extremity, and gradually lowering as it approaches the southern end. The whole is covered with forest wow jungle, excepting in a few places where it has been i for purposes of cultivation. The highest hill on range is called \"Western Hill.\" It is 2,922 feet ah level of the sea, and commanding an extensive view of sixty miles to the west and north. Next in height to this is the \" Great Hill,\" or Flagstaff Hill, which is at the north of the eastern range. It . stands about 2,500 feet above the sea. Here is a signal station, whence communication is made by telegraph to the fort below ; and here also is a sanatorium for invalids, consisting of a few good and comfortable bun- galows, supplied with glazed windows, and all the ordinary appurtenances of Anglo-Indian life. Pleasure-walks inter- sect the summit of the hills in the immediate vicinity ofthe two government bungalows \u2014 one of which is kept up for the accommodation of the Governor of the settlemi the other, the \"Convalescent\" bungalow, is let out at a mo- derate rent for the convenience of invalid visitors. In th gardens are a variety of kinds of the English rose, flowers and shrubs, and a kitchen-garden yields cabbage, turnips,"], [379, "355 PENANG, peas, potatoes, and strawberries, and most of the fruits and vegetables of India. The Convalescent Bungalow is let for one month at a time \u2014 officers in the Company's service have a preference over other individuals, when there is any com petition for the use of the building ; when no officer applies, private individuals may use the house upon the same terms and rent. A road through the forest connects the Great Hill with the Western Hill. It is three miles in length, \u2014 in no part very steep \u2014 in some parts nearly flat \u2014 throughout of a good width, generally in very passable order, and nearly in every part shaded by the wood at asi times of the day. The other hills are named severally, Feme Hsil, Bellevue, Strawberry Hsil, the Highlands of Scotland, and Mount Elvira, Clubley's and Ibbetson's Hsils, and Belmont on the Pentland chain. On the summit of most of these hills are European dwellings, and clove and other plantations. On the eastern range of mountains, are Soongy Neebong Hill, Low's Hsil (named after Captain Low, who constructed some excellent pieces of road on the island), Mount Rostaling, the highest point of the range, called Bookit Gambier (1,500 feet above the sea), Kocheye's Hill, and others. Penang offers to the invalid in India asi the advantages of a msid and varied csimate. The temperature of the Great Hsil is from 67\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 in the morning, and from 76\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 in the middle of the day. Exercise on foot can be taken without inconvenience from the heat of the sun until eight a. m., and after four p. m. The expenses of a single indi vidual are not great. A table-servant, a lamplighter, a waterman, a cook, a syce, a washerman, a sweeper, and a bazaar-man (who all proceed daily into the plains to market for the invalid), cost forty-two Spanish dosiars per month. Provisions are moderate, and can be obtained daily by the bazaar-man. The best bungalows on the hsils may be rented for eighteen to fifty dollars, but the one on the Pentlands is seldom let out for rent ; the proprietor (hitherto) has libe rally lent it to visitors, who may not have been otherwise accommodated. Penang is one of the richest islands \u2014 considering its size and the quantity of land under cultivation \u2014 in the universe. Its staple produce consists of betel-nut, cocoa-nut, nutmegs, 2 A 2"], [380, "356 PRINCIPAL OBJECTS. and cloves. There are not fewer than 250,000 nutmeg trees on the island and in the Province Wellesley, the annual yield ofwhich ranges between twenty and twenty-fi*,. lions of nutmegs. The clove-trees are 80,000 in number, of which 30,000 to 40,000 bear fruit. The produce averages eighty piculs annually. The town of Penang, called by the English George Town, with a fort named Fort Cornwallis, is situated on the north eastern corner of the island, in lat. 5\u00b0 '25' N. Thr government of the island abides here \u2014 the Governor being a civilian of the East-India Company's service, and called a Resident Councillor. His authority also extends to Pn. Wellesley, a tract of land on the Malayan peninsula, opposite Penang, and sold to the British by the king of (_iiei_a, in the year 1800. The island was acquired from the same authority in 1785. He gave it to one Captain Light, as the marriage-portion of his daughter, whom Light espoused, and it was by Light transferred to the British government. Penang is separated into districts, some of which contain sufficiently remarkable objects. In the district of Tanjong Tokong, which is bounded on the east bythe sea, and on the north by. the distri* Tulloh Teecoose and the sea, is a rock called by the Chinese Pulo Ticoose, and consecrated by them as a temple. It ha occasioned frequent disputes among the different sects, even to bloodshed, and one of the congsi, or communities, a few years ago, paid 450 dollars for the rock, and an acre of ground around it, that they might have a superior claim to the place. The spot is one of the most frequented in the settlement, from the number of Chinese who proceed thither laden with fruit and sweetmeats, offerings to the Jos. In this district is the Macao-Chinese burying-ground, and beyond the beach is an extensive tract of land, 3U0 acres in extent, entirely covered with pine apples. Pulo Ticoose village, or Burmah town, situated south of Tanjong Tokong, contains several public buildings or tutions, of which the General College, or Anglo-Chine** College, is one. It is under the control of French \u25a0_-\u00bb aries.

As the inmates of the institution belong to various nations, a language common to all is required, the Latin tongue supplies the deficiency, and becomes the usual channel for exchanging ideas. The college is situated close to the sea, and about half a mile from it is a Roman Catholic church. In Sepoy Line and D/toby Ghaut villages is the canton ment of the troops, who are employed in the defence of Pe nang \u2014 generally a detachment from the Madras army. The cautonment consists of Attop huts, built in rows running parallel, and intersected at right angles by others. Adjoin ing the cantonment is a parade-ground, a military hospital, adapted to the accommodation of fifty soldiers ; a general hospital, a leper hospital, aud lunatic asylum ; a poor-house for the reception and maintenance of 100 poor and destitute people, and the remains of a reservoir. Hasi' a mile east of the jail is a cenotaph, erected to the memory of Mr. David Brown, of Glugore, who, during a residence of twenty-five years in the island, prosecuted with great success tbe two professions of merchant and planter. When the price of Penang pepper fell, and would no longer yield a profit, he turned his attention to the growth of the nutmeg and clove \u25a0 \u2014 cleared- extensive tracts of jungle, and fully established the capability of the island for that kind of cultivation. The Ayer Trujan district, which embraces a large extent of forest and hill, and has as many as 32,000 betel-nut trees, contains a waterfall, which is justly regarded as one of the most interesting and pretty spots on the island. The height from the plain to where the stream, formed by the rains which have accumulated on the Great Hill and High lands of Scotland, first breaks over the rocks, is nearly 500 feet, but the fall in its progress is broken at several places. Where it commences, the water turns abruptly over masses of grey granite, and falls nearly perpendicularly for about 200 feet \u2014 after that there is a succession of smaller falls. In the Ayer Etam district, on a picturesque spot near the base of the west mountain range, are some mills, erected about the year 1808 by Lowe Ammee, a very indefatigable and intelligent Canton Chinaman, who had for some time before removed from Calcutta to the island, and established himself as a baker. The ground comprising this estate is"], [382, "358 LOWE AMMEE. about twenty-six furlongs in extent, and was originally planted out with pepper, and yielded abundantly ; but, iii consequence of the fall in price of the article, the plantation was neglected and ultimately allowed to go to ruin. I this, however, Lowe Ammee substituted some coo and other fruit trees for the withering pepper vines perceiving the advantages which a commodious natural basin, situated in a commanding part of the estate, held out roi erecting water-mills, by which he would be enabled more facility to supply the daily -increasing demands on his bakery, he immediately commenced operations, by excavating and opening a course from numerous rills at the foot - hills, from which the water was successfully conveyed into the basin. With the pecuniary assistance of a European merchant, and the encouragement held out to him hy Admiral Sir Edward Pesiew (afterwards Lord Exmouth), Lowe Ammee built the mills and a substantial bungalow contiguous to them, at a cost, it is said, of 40,000 dollars. The bungalow was converted into a splendid tavern for the accommodation and comfort of visitors, and there was a constant succession of pleasure parties to the mills ; and nothing was wanting which could give the highest gratifica- tion \u2014 convenient and airy apartments, neat and clean furni- ture, substantial and good fare, excellent wines, beer, tfec, at moderate prices, together with two very comfortable separate bathing-houses for male and female visitors, built on the borders of the basin, aud several shower-baths. This port being then the naval depot, Lowe Ammee soon clean outlay, and in the year 1811, when the expedition pron to the conquest of Java, and the msils were working inces- santly day and night, he gained nearly a lac of dollars on the bread and other supplies he furnished. Instead, however, of returning to China, as many of his friends recommended (being then advanced in years although in robust health), he resumed pepper-planting on large tracts of land, whl only cost an enormous expense in clearing, but still I sums in the planting-out and taking care of the vines, \u2022 commence producing about the third year. Lowe Av now found his resources much cramped ; and every pr of prices falling, he leased his plantations to a eompn Chinese for trifling sums, and retired from business. After"], [383, "359 CHINESE CEMETERIES. selling his msils and other landed property, he returned to China about seventeen or eighteen years ago, at the advanced age of seventy-six years, respected by all classes of the com munity. The mills, &c, built by Ammee, are now in a complete state of ruin, and the floors of some of the out houses are turned into vegetable gardens. Another mill, on a smaller scale, has been more recently erected ; and cold shower-baths are still kept up, to which Chinese and others frequently resort. The place is yet well worthy of a visit. There is also a Hindoo Temple in this district, erected by a Bengalese washerwoman originally named Luckia, who came to this island from Calcutta, under the auspices of its founder, Mr. Light, accompanied by several followers, both male and female, of tbe same calling, perfectly versed in their business ; and such was the extent of the patronage she enjoyed, that in a very few years she became possessed of considerable property, and amongst the Hindoos acquired the sobriquet of Bannee Dobin, Queen Washerwoman. She shortly afterwards retired from business, in favour of her children and relatives ; but previously thereto, made suitable provisions for them and built the temple, which she endowed with ample rents derived from a fruit-garden. Owing, how ever, to the mismanagement by her executors of her charit}', a few years after her death, no assets remained with which to make the requisite repairs of tbe temple, so that it soon became much dilapidated, and is now almost in ruins. The liberality of the old Bannee towards the poorer classes of the Hindoos was extensive and unceasing, and she continued to retain the respect and esteem of her countrymen, and no doubt would have lived many years longer ; but, having been discovered to be impsicated in a very daring robbery which was committed in the Honourable Company's warehouse, about the year 1811, she was tried, found guilty, and sen tenced to be put in the psilory and imprisoned for two years, which preyed so much upon her mind, that she did not long survive the termination of her sentence. The largest burial-ground in the settlement is in the Batoo Souchong Jelutong district ; it belongs to the Chin chew or Hokeon Chinese ; the one in the Tanjong Tokong district belongs to the Macao Chinese. A grant of a portion of the present burial-ground was obtained many years ago"], [384, "360 CHINESE TOMBS. from government ; but on its becoming filled, about fortv- eight furlongs more were purchased by general - amongst the Chinchew Chinese community, and it now may occupy a space of eighty acres: there are, moreover, several private cemeteries belonging to different Chinese, and nit >- gether Batoo Souchong has obtained from these peo preference, for this purpose, over all other parts of tin i A hilly situation is generally chosen, the high - points o_ which are preferred, being, as they suppose, nearest to I and their practice in depositing the body is to plice th. upwards, and the feet, of course, directed towards the hill : a tablet, when erected, is always fixed at the foot of the grave, so that on one side of the hill the tablets will all look to the east, on another side to the west, &c. A s-tone wall of a foot or eighteen inches in height encloses an oval- piece of ground in front of the tablet, the surface of which is levelled and polished with chunam ; a gutter runs ti the wall, and opens a little way down the hill, which to carry off the rain or water collected from the gin the surface of the tablet further np. Sometimes two or more graves are placed parallel and close to each other : in such cases there is only one oval space in front common tn asi ; each, however, is furnished with a tablet, but gei there is an inscription on only one of these, which indicates it to be the grave of the head of the family. A small stone will usually be observed at the left-hand side of the oval space ; this is to commemorate tho Tokong of the dead, at which the relatives of the deceased annually offer prayers aud sacrifices for his benefit. A Chinaman feels great concern for tbe comfort of his remains : these are often directed to be sent in a substantial box, made of hard planks, several inches in diameter, which he had procured for the purpose before his death, furnished with several, but always an odd number of, suits of clothes, and with articles of diet of every kind, to be deposited in a tomb, the building of which he had himself superintended. The tomb of the Che Wan, one of the first settlers in the island, and a man of considerable note in his day, is well worth looking at : he spent the last two years of his life in erecting it, and the granite of wliich it is built was cut into psilars under his own eye ; after it was completed, he actually lived in it as a hermit"], [385, "361 MALACCA. for a few months before his death, and, after his health had suffered much, he was forcibly removed by his relatives to his house in town, where he died a few days after. The coffin is of so substantial a material, that the body, after being deposited in it, was kept in the house for several months before interment, without inconvenience or smell. Sim Wha, a wealthy Chinese merchant, who died here, was thus kept for three months and a half, and was then buried in a private piece of ground in this district, and there is a fine tomb now erected over this spot. Fickyua, a Macao Chinese, died here some years ago, and his body was kept in a coffin for upwards of twelve months, and thereafter shipped in a vessel to Macao. In the Jelutong village in the district Zallah Jelutong, extensive piggeries have also been for some time erected ; the refuse of the cocoa-nuts after the oil has been extracted, supplies food for the hogs, and the town is principally fur nished with pork from this tillage. It is now one of the most populous vsilages in the settlement. The canine species are here exceedingly numerous, and most troublesome to passengers. It is scarcely possible to pass without being beset with twenty or thirty half-starved yelping curs, which have neither music in their voice, nor beauty in their form. Dog-flesh is known to form an article of food with the Chinese ; the Macao Chinese are especially fond of it, and no dish is relished by them more than that made from a fat dog. There is a particular species called the chowchow dog, which is the only kind valued for its meat. The dogs of this breed have black tongues and long hair ; the altogether black or white ones are preferred. The Chinese of the Basi Pulo district feed dogs for the purpose, which they first castrate, so as to produce in them a disposition to obesity, and by this means and good living they succeed wonderfully in producing dogs as fat as, and having much the appearance of, pigs. They form a great contrast to the miserable wretches noticed in this district. Malacca. \u2014 Six centuries ago Malacca was a jungle.

Duriug the next 130 years, Portugal, in its paliniept impressed an European character on Malacca ; ami thi a stisi longer period, a more kindred nation, the I \u2022iitcli, pre pared it for the reception of English residents.

Prejudices of blood and rehgion have been broken down or subdued.

Christian and heathen, Papist and heretic, men of every tongue, and race, and colour, not only live in perfect harmony, but mingle their blood without any misgivings. It would have been a sin against Nature, here so gracious and bounteous, had humanity proved more stubborn. This harmonious diversity, which marks tbe people themselves, extends to their archi tecture and asi their habits of sife. The great cause of this peculiar character of Malacca is the fertility and beauty of the country, and the remarkable purity and salubrity of the air. Nature has been profusely bountiful to the Malay Peninsula, in bestowing on it a climate the most agreeable and healthful \u2014 a soil luxutiantly fertilized by numerous rivers, and the face of the country diversified with hills and valleys, mountains and plains, forming the most beautiful and interesting scenery that it is possible for the imagination to figure. Yet under the Dutch government no attempt was made to evolve the rich products of the land. Tin the narrow and sordid policy which marked their rule in the Straits, the country continued in a state of primitive nature, but no sooner were the restrictions of the Dutch taken off by the English, and fusi frberty given to every species of agriculture, than industry began to show itself very rapidly. The district produces sufficient grain for the consumption n"], [387, "363 MINES, PORT, CLIMATE. the settlement, andTa superfluity is left for exportation. The paddy (rice in the husk) grows most luxuriantly, and yields from two to three hundred fold. The vegetation is abun dant, beyond what is to be met with in any other pkrt of India ; the sugar-cane is equal to any produced in Java, and far exceeds that of Bengal ; coffee, cotton, indigo, chocolate, pepper, and spices have all been tried and found to thrive remarkably well. The spontaneous productions of the sosi are very numerous, consisting of an almost endless variety of the richest and most delicious fruits ; amongst which the far-famed mangosteen holds the first rank, and attains a higher perfection here than probably anywhere else ; indeed, Malacca stands quite unrivalled in the quantity, variety, and agreeable flavour of its fruits. The country is covered with very fine and durable timber for ship and house busiding, although not enriched with forests of teak. But it is from her tin mines that Malacca draws the largest portion of her wealth. Five years ago no less than forty tin mines were in operation, and from that time the number has greatly increased. The stream tin of the Malayan peninsula, however, is so abundant that ages may elapse before it will be necessary to resort to the process of mining to any larger extent. This stanniferous region is so great that, although it has long been wrought, not a single valley has been thoroughly worked, and not one valley in a thou sand has probably heen touched. The stream tin of Great Britain sufficed for the wants of centuries, and even with the vastly increased demand of the present age, it is impos sible to predict the time when the alluvial tin of a region so many times greater than the stanniferous tracts of Great Britain wisi be exhausted. The capability of Malacca for the productions of superior sugar are now being tested by Sugar Companies, and a large addition to the revenue is the result of this just appreciation of the richness of the sosi. The port of Malacca is beyond all comparison the most convenient of any in the Straits for ships to touch at for refreshments, and the supplies procurable here are most abundant, and at very reasonable rates. All kinds of poultry, fish, vegetables, fruit, tfec, are to be had at all seasons of the year. Oxen cannot be obtained, but buffaloes are very plen tiful, and of the finest kind. Sheep are scarce \u2014 they are all"], [388, "364 SINGAPORE. importetl from Bengal\"; but goats and hogs D at moderate prices. Nothing can more strongly pro what extent, supplies are obtainable at Malacca khan the fact of the expedition to Java having ii I IM 1, during which period not less than 30,000 men were furnished daily with fresh provisions of every !. greatest abundance. The climate of Malacca is one of the best in J extremes of heat and cold are never experienced \u2014 tin perature is of the most agreeable uniformity. The tl meter ranges from 72\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 throughout the j exceeding the latter, or falling much below the former. The mornings and evenings are particularly cool nd and the nights are seldom hot and sultry. There are regular dry and rainy monsoons at Malacca as on the c India ; the rains, however, are more constant and hea the months of September, October, and part of No\\ 1 1 than during the rest of the year ; and from the month of December to the middle of March, whilst the imrtli-east wind blows the strongest, the weather is considerably drier than in the other months. Very little variation take in the barometer at Malacca ; during the year it is found to fluctuate between 30\u00b0 3' the highest\u2014 and 29\u00b0 33' the lowest, giving an annual variation of only one-fifth of an inch. The population of Malacca amounts to about 50,000 per sons. The census in 1818 gave a population of 25,000. In 1836 it had increased to 30,700 souls; the greater portion of whom are Chinese labourers. Malacca is under the government of one of the councillors to whom the Straits are intrusted. The Recorder of Penang administers justice here upon the principles of English law recognised throughout the Presidencies of India. Singapore is a small island at the southern extremity of Malaya.

Singapore, a small island, situated in the embou chure of straits difficult of navigation, without internal resources adequate for the food of its inhabitants, limited in extent, and whosiy dependent upon the advantages a free port derives from the circumstance of a total absence of com mercial restriction, has risen up from a small and insignifi cant speck in tbe Straits of Malacca to be a British settle ment, and to form an entrepot for the manufactured industry of Great Britain, second only in importance to the extensive and cherished colony of Australasia. As a spice-producing settlement, Singapore disappointed the hopes that formed the chimerical reason for its establish ment ; but, as an entrepot of trade, its commercial value has exceeded the most sanguine expectations. Happsiy for the colony, its institution and early growth were placed under the fostering care of a man of genius \u2014 one of a hberal mind and a man enthusiasticasiy devoted to fully developing the resources of the colony. We refer to the amiable and accom plished Sir Thomas Stamford Baffles, Bart., whose name and memory are connected with everything calculated to advance the happiness of mankind. The settlement, notwithstanding many difficulties which would have prostrated the energies of other than English commerciasists, rapidly advanced. Commerciasiy and positically considered, the progressive spirit of tradal enterprise, as manifested at Singapore, has been uninterrupted. It is true, causes have been in opera tion to restrict or retard mercantile operations ; but stsil, the onward progress has been one either of unexampled but temporary prosperity, or (wh. t is far preferable) of posi tive stability. It is not from flitting and temporary cheer fulness, brou'ght about by apparent prosperity, that commer cial economists draw their inferences \u2014 which varies with the influences in operation and ceases with the vivacity of their action \u2014 it is the positive stabisity which a branch of trade assumes that forms the ground of congratulation. The position in tradal economics, just mentioned, Singapore has attained. The entire trade of the place, in 1823-24, did not amount to one crore and forty lacs of rupees; in 1833-34,"], [390, "366 SUGAR PLANTATIONS. the tradal commercial values were set down at less tlm crores of rupees; in 1845-46 (a year somewhat below the average of the immediately preceding years), the n hibit a total value of more than four crores of rupe in the last year, 1853, they did not fall short of six crores. The opening of the five ports in China, following imme diately in the path of peace with the Celestial empii enlarged expectations in Europe of the advantag. from the intercourse which would follow the introdud European fabrics into the heart of China. Not to enter on the discussion of the fasiacy of Utopian tradal facility which the opening of the five port throughout Europe, an impetus was given to comn. enterprise which augmented greatly the number of Eui merchants at China and Singapore. At the latter place six new firms were estabhshed, whilst some of the long-established merchants opened branch houses in China, with the view of participating in the advan tages offered there, and of carrying on a material portion of the trade which it was expected would be removed from Singapore thence. In China, some hundred firms, or more, have been established since 1840, The business at Singapore was formerly divided amongst twelve European bou>< stead of eighteen, as at present. Some of the new firms have exhibited a spirit of commercial rivalry, so as to urge the elder ones to renewed exertions. A very few years ago, the whole of this island was only one great jungle, which merely required capital and prise to convert it into one of the most lovely and productive spots on the face of the globe. Within the past ten however, numerous plantations of sugar and cloves have been laid out, and cocoa-nut groves have been planted, and there is good reason to believe, that under an acti\\. fostering government the anticipations as to the beauty anel prosperity of the island wsil be realized. A wonderful in crease has taken place in the population. In 1823 it did not exceed (in round numbers) 10,000 persons, of whom 4,500 were Malays, 3,200 Chinese, and only seventy Euro peans. In 1845, the census exhibited 204 Europeans, 6.000 Malays, and 32,132 Chinese, of whom 28,765 were males. A much greater number of Chinese is now to be found on"], [391, "367 GUTTA PERCHA. the island, owing to the sugar plantations, which have greatly mcreased. Singapore being a free port, great numbers of vessels from the eastward resort to the island, landing their cargoes, which are then carried thence by other vessels trading to the westward. The Governor of the Straits' settlements has his head-quarters at Singapore, and here also reside a con siderable number of merchants and planters. Besides the sugar and spices grown here, Singapore and its vicinity yield the gutta-percha tree. Although the trees yielding gutta percha abound in the indigenous forests of Malaya, it is only ten years since the substance was discovered and its utisity appreciated by Europeans. The gutta-percha tree, or gutta tubon, as it ought more properly to be called \u2014 the percha producing a spurious article \u2014 belongs to the natural family Sapotex, but differs so much from all described genera, having alliance with both arras and bassia, but varying in some essentials from both, that it is entitled to rank as a new genus. The tree is of large size, froni sixty to seventy feet in height, and from two to three in diameter. Its general appearance resembles the genus Durio, or well known Doarian, so much so as to strike the most superficial observer. The under surface of the leaf, however, is of a more reddish and decided brown than the Durio, and the shape is somewhat different. The range of its growth ap pears to be considerable ; it being found all up the Malayan peninsula as far as Penang, where it is abundant, although the inhabitants were not aware of the fact for some time, several of the mercantile houses there having sent down orders to Singapore for supplies of the article, when they had the means of supply close at hand. The tree is also found in Borneo, and most of the islands adjacent. The locasities it particularly likes are the alluvial traces along the foot of hsils, where it flourishes luxuriantly, forming, in many spots, the principal portion of the jungle. But notwithstanding the indigenous character of the tree, its apparent abundance, and wide-spread diffusion, the gutta wsil soon become a very scarce article, if some more provi dent means be not adopted in its collection than that at present in use by the Malays and Chinese. The mode in which the natives obtain the gutta, is by cutting down the"], [392, "368 GUTTA PERCHA. trees of full growth, and ringing the bark at distances of about twelve to eighteen inches apart, and placiDg a cocoa nut shesi, spathe of a palm, or such-liko i fallen trunk to receive the milky sap that im mediately exudes upon every fresh incision. This sap is bamboos, taken to their houses, and boiled, in ord. off the watery particles, and inspissate it to the consi it finally assumes. Although the process oi necessary when the gutta is collected in a large quantity, if a tree be freshly wounded, a small quantity allowed to e and it be collected and moulded iu the hand, it will 001 date perfectly in a few minutes, and have all the appearance of the prepared article. When it is quite pure the colour is of a grayish white, but as brought to market it is more ordinarily found of a reddish hue, arising from chips of hark that fasi into the sap in the act of making the incisions, and which yield their colour to it. Besides these acci.. chips, there is a great deal of intentional adulteration, by sawdust and other materials. Even in the purest specimens, one pound of the substance yields, on being cleaned, one ounce of impurities. Fortunately it is neither difficult to detect nor clean the gutta of foreign matter ; it being only necessary to bosi it in water until wesi softened, roll out the substance into thin sheets, and pick out all impurities, which is easily done, as the gutta does not adhere to anything, and all foreign matter is merely entangled in its fibres, not incor porated with its substance. The quantity of solid gutta obtained from each tree varies from five to twenty cotties, so that, taking the average at ten cotties, which is a toleiably liberal one, it will require the destruction of ten trees to produce one picuL Gutta percha, when fresh and pure, is not affected by boihng alcohol, but dissolves readily in boiling spirits of turpentine, also in naptha and coal-tar. A good cement for luting bottles and other purposes, is formed by bt ther equal parts of gutta, coal-tar, and resin. When required for use, it can always be made plastic by putting the pot containing it over the fire for a few minutea The gutta itself is highly inflammable ; a strip cut off takes sight, and burns with a bright flame, emitting sparks, and dropping a black residuum in the manner of sealing-wax, which in its"], [393, "369 CEYLON. combustion it very much resembles. But the great pecu liarity of this substance, and that which makes it so emi nently useful for many purposes, is the effect of bosiing water upon it. When immersed for a few minutes in water above 150 degrees of Fahr., it becomes soft and plastic, so as to be capable of being moulded to any required shape or form, which it retains upon coosing. If a strip of it be cut off and plunged into boiling water, it contracts in size, both in length and breadth. This is a very anomalous and remarkable phenomenon, apparently opposed to all the laws of heat. It is this plasticity when plunged into boiling water that has asiowed of its being applied to so many useful purposes, and which first induced some Malays to fabricate it into whips, which were brought into town, and led to its further notice. The natives subsequently extended these manufactures to buckets, basins and jugs, shoes, traces, vessels for coosing wine, and several other domestic uses ; it has now been for some years in universal use in Europe. Of asi the purposes, however, to which it may be adapted, none is so valuable as its applicability to the practice of sur gery. Here it becomes one of the most useful auxiliaries to that branch of the healing art, which of all is the least con jectural. Its easy plasticity and power of retaining any shape given to it when cool, at once pointed it out as suit able for the manufacture of many instruments which hitherto had been made of India- rubber and leather. CEYLON. This island is called by the inhabitants Singhala. It is inhabited chiefly by a race of men similar in their physical characteristics to the natives of the south of India, but for the most part of the Buddhist, and not of the Brahminical species of the general rehgion of India ; and after hating been in part subdued, and for a time occupied, first by the Portuguese, and then by the Dutch, it is now wholly conquered and possessed by the British, as a colony in immediate dependence on the Queen's government. Although situated nearer to the equator than is the Indian peninsula, the meteorological position of Ceylon is a more advantageous one, so that its climate is milder and more 2 B"], [394, "370 PRODUCTIONS OF CEYLON. equable, its surface is better watered, to which also the nature of its geological formation contributes ; and in quence of all this, and of its peculiar positical conditi affords a very favourable specimen of the most i productive of the intertropical regions of Asia ' egg-shaped, with 220 miles of extreme length by 145 of extreme breadth, and its coast is very little broken by or other irregularities of outline. It the general aspect of a region of irregularly-disposed \u2022 tain ranges, several of the peaks being of great h the whole surrounded by a wide belt of more i country on the sea-coast, intersected by many rivers, of ex tremely circuitous course, and covered with vegeh including a great variety of fruit aud forest trees and shrubs, affording, for its principal agricultural productions, the cocoa, banana, and areca palms (with arrack, oil, an cordage, made from the cocoa tree), cinnamon, coffee, tobacco, sugar, both of the cane and the cocoa-tree, and rice, which is the principal food of the inhabitants. In additi these agricultural productions, its land or its sea affords to commerce several varieties of building, cabinet, and dye woods, buck-horns, gems, chank shells, and pearls. It abounds in elephants ; but these are of little use in com merce, as they generally afford no ivory, and liave ceased to be much in demand for war and labour, and they are slaughtered in great numbers as wild game, and to deliver the cultivators from the injury they do to the crops. Ceylon consists, with reservation of parts of the sea-coast, and of some few exceptional substances in the interior, wholly of primitive rock, as green-stone, granite, agenite, and espe cially gneiss ; these rocks, in every degree of combinatinu, forming the body of the island, and the soil consisting of its disintegrated or decomposed ingredients, in which felspar and quartz greatly predominate, enriched, in some parts, though very ssightly, by vegetable accretions, and by natural or artificial irrigation. Among the mineral substances, ex ceptional to the general substance of the interior of the island, are nitre caves, plumbago, manganese, and iron ores, and small ledges of dolomite. Gold and quickssiver are spoken of by some authors ; but Davy and other careful inquirers positively aver that no such things are to be found in Ceylon. The mountains and hills of Ceylon, according to"], [395, "371 THE CINNAMON. what is usual elsewhere, in the case of rocks of the same famsiy, generally have rounded summits and sides, but with deep valleys and ravines, in which the rivers flow. It is a singularity of their structure here, that with scarcely a marked exception, all the valleys have outlets, and it is very rare to see in the interior a lake or a pond. AU the vasiey bottoms and descending gorges, as well as the levels, are planted with rice, the sosi, where the nature of the ground requires it, being trained into terraces, one above the other, fronted with small embankments, which retain the water, and afford the means of crossing the overflowed paddy fields. In certain parts of the island the earth is capable of being cut up into cubical lumps, of a substance called by the natives cabook, which is much used in building walls, as a substitute for brick. It is a highly felspathic granite rock, in a state of imperfect decomposition, and the great quantity of felspar occurring in parts of the island, gives to the sosi of those tracts a hardish clayey structure, which is very distinguishable in the smooth and firm surface of the roadsides in the interior, wherever the disposition of the ground has given occasion for deep cuts. The circum stances of produce and manufacture, which are quite special to Ceylon, are the cinnamon culture, the cocoa culture, the chank and pearl fishery ; the building, cabinet, and dye woods, and precious stones. The cinnamon culture in its perfect state is almost a monopoly of the island of Ceylon, and its growth is confined to a very narrow tract of land on the south-west side of the island, chiefly in the neighbour hood of Colombo ; this does not seem to be the result of pohtical arrangement merely, but to arise from some inap preciable virtue in the combination of climate, soil, and water, and their relation to each other in the island of Ceylon, and in this part of it. Some of these peculiarities it is easy to indicate, without its being so easy to understand why the particular consequence should follow. The cinnamon-tree (Laurus cinnamonuni) in its natural state grows to the height of about twenty feet ; but the bark, wliich is the only valuable part, is found to lose much of its highly aromatic quasity in the mature tree. Accordingly the trees are cut young, when the stems are only sive or six feet long, and less than an inch thick at the largest end. 2 B 2"], [396, "372 COCOA-NUT, PEARI_S, WOODS. The bark is then stripped, or peeled off in long pieces like wsilow bark, scraped carefully to preserve its cuticle, an out to dry, in doing which it curls up in quills, as they are called, and it is then ready for the market ; but improves by keeping for a while. The wood is good for nothing but fuel. Owing to this mode of cultivation, the cinnamon garden has very much the appearance of a forest of seruk on' rich bright green leaves of the small trees being stni in contrast with the white sand of the plain in which they grow. It is possible that the fragrance of the cinnamon groves may have been sensible to voyagers along the c . Ceylon, but there is very little of this fragrance pen-, in the gardens themselves, and the idea of its ext. to sea is laughed at in Colombo. The cocoa-tree culu the next in order. In the moist, wann climate of Ceylon, many species of palm flourish, and they constitute a class of objects amongst the most beautiful in the landscapes of the island : they are of great and various uses in the arts of life and in commerce. The talipot, the areca, the banai;. royal cocoa, and the ordinary cocoa trees, are tin spicuous and interesting of the trees of this class. The i tree above all is valuable, not only for its esculent nut and its milk, but for the arrack, the sugar, the oil, tin the thatching, and other secondary things, which are derived from its trunk, its fruit, or its leaves \u2014 in consequence of which every cocoa-tree is a precious property, and is the subject of a tax to the government. Thirdly \u2014 the chank and pearl fisheries. AU the women of India are accust to wear a number of rings on their ancles and arms, especially on the latter ; these are made sometimes of metal, sometimes of other materials, among which a large shesi found in the waters of Ceylon, a species of Buccinum, is very much in request, and of which a great amount is sent to other parts of British India. But the demand for pearls is still more universal in the East ; and their adoption as an article of personal ornament in Christendom also extends the demand to Europe. The pearl oyster-beds lie in the Straits of Manaar, between Ceylon and the mainland of India These two fisheries are held by the government, and fanred out to individuals, under very stringent regulations \u2014 the pearl oyster-beds, especially, require repose for the renovation and"], [397, "adam's peak. 373 growth of the oyster, without which the whole fishery would soon be exhausted by irregular divers, and thus destroyed. Accordingly, it is only at intervals of several years that pearl fishing is permitted by the government. Fourthly, \u2014 as to the busiding, cabinet, and dye woods. Of these a great diversity is found in Ceylon, among which the most noticeable are \u2014 teak-wook ebony (Diospyrus ebenus), calamander-wood, jack-wood (Artocarpus integrifolia), black-wood (Dalbergia latifolia), nepan-wood, satin-wood, sandal-wood (Santalum album) ; some of the foregoing woods are very beautiful, but they do not equal in beauty the mahogany, maple, black walnut, curled birch, cherry tree, and others, which are commonly employed for cabinet-work in America and Europe. Sapan-wood (Casalpiiua sapan), to which add, though it be not a forest-tree, the dye-root called chay; this is a plant cultivated for the roots alone, which furnished the colouring matter of the durable red for which the chintzes of India are famous : the wild plant in Ceylon is considered preferable to the cultivated, and the right to dig for it is farmed out. This dye-stuff has been tried in Europe, but not with very advantageous results. The highest mountain in Ceylon is Adam's Peak. It is about 8,000 feet above the level of the sea, and has seldom been ascended, because of the difficulty of the latter part of the ascent, which is quite perpendicular. To the followers of Buddha and Mahomet, the summit of the mountain is equally the centre of attraction, as the monument of the life and existence of an extraordinary man. The former assert that on one of Buddha's visits to the island, he left the impression of his foot, as an evidence of his power and an object of worship for his followers ; the Mahomedans, on the other hand, contend that Adam, after spending his paradisaical happiness in Ceylon, endured there his penance sikewise, subsequently to his fall, by standing on the summit of the peak on one foot for a long series of years, and that hence arose the impression. But were there even no traditions of the sort to hallow the mountain, its extreme height, its peculiar shape, and the distance to which it can be seen at sea, would alone render it worthy of attention to asi who visit the island. The foot impression upon the summit has probably had a longer period of reputed sanctity and worship"], [398, "374 COLOMBO. than any other object of reverence in the East ; but to a late traveller, the impression, like most other natural curiosities of the same kind, is a complete deception. The summit of the mountain is rocky and surrounded by a wall about five feet high, in the shapo of an irregular hexagon, by the side of which a level path has been formed, encircling the rocks, which rise to a height cf about eight feet in tho centre (on the top of which is the holy foot-print), and which are again overtopped by the wooden temple surmouut ing it. \" In the rock itself,\" writes a recent visitor, \" there is no indentation resembling a footstep, and were it not that some judicious devotees have made a good use of mortar and a trowel, the visitor would gaze for a long time before he would fancy he saw anything of the kind. Even, as it is, were the plastered separations of the toes removed, one woidd be much more ready to take it for the impression of a door with a semicircular top than for that of a foot; it is four feet and a half long, by two feet and a quarter - During the months of visitation by the pilgrims, it is pre served, by a metal cover glittering with glass diamonds the too inquiring gaze of unbelieving or wavering sci , Tbe border which makes the outline of the impression is about four inches broad, made of coarse lime, painted ; and the temple which surmounts the imposition is about six feet hy five in extent. It is supported by chains running from the corners of the roof to the outside of the wasis, where they are firmly fastened to the rock\" Colombo \u2014 the capital and seat of the British govern ment in Ceylon, is situated on the north-west coast, in 6\u00b0 56 north latitude, and 79\u00b0 49' east longitude, and 368 miles south-west of Madras. It is a commonly received opinion that the name was derived from a mango-tree (of that species which the Singhalese casi colomba) which stood conspicuous at this place in olden times. Knox adds that the Portu g in compliment to Columbus, the celebrated navigator, changed it to Columbo or Colombo. This etymology is, however, inadmissible, for in the Singhalese grammar, \" SidaltanJia Sangraha,\" the word Colomba is explained as signifying a \" sea-port,\" and also \" a fort ; \" and in the former sense it seems to have been applied to the metropolis of the island, from its maritime situation. The fort of Colombo is situated"], [399, "375 COLOMBO. on a small projection of land washed by the sea, about two thirds of its extent. Though not very extensive, it is strong both by art and nature, and embraces a circuit of nearly a msie and a quarter. The ramparts are very strong, having eight principal bastions, and a number of lesser works com municating one with the other all round. At the foot of the ramparts, on the inside, is a bouedary which extends round the whole fort, and communicates with the bastions and soldiers' barracks, and also affords, at the different angles, open spaces for their private parades. The whole of the fort is surrounded (except that side which is next the sea) by a deep ditch or fosse ; and adjoining the covert- way, and at the foot of the glacis, is a lake having communication with the Mutwal river. In the interior of the fort are several straight and regular streets, with smaller ones crossing at right angles ; the former being ornamented with double rows of sooria trees, which afford a delightful shade. The residence of the governor, the King's House, is in King Street, and behind it is the Lighthouse, a beautiful edifice, the sight of which is ninety-seven feet above the level of the sea, and in clear weather may be seen as far as the light is visible above the horizon. All the Military Offices, the Commissioner of Revenue, the Vice Admiralty Court, with the General Post Office, are within the fort ; there are, besides, an Engsish church styled St. Peter's, a sibrary, a medical museum, a hospital, two hotels, and numerous shops. The lake at the back of the fort, before alluded to, almost insulates the town, connected as it is with the Mutwal river by canals ; and a lock having been formed at St. Sebastian's, the inland navi gation is carried through the fort to tbe sea-beach. In the centre of the lake is a tongue of land, denominated Slave Island, from the use to which it was formerly applied by the Dutch. It is numerously covered with cocoa-nut and other trees, which afford an excellent shade. That part nearest to the fort is very cool, being only separated from the sea by an isthmus, usually called the Galle Face. Communication with this place with either the town or the fort is very easy by land, passing over a very pretty little stone bridge, which opens to the south end of the Galle Face, near the tillage of Colbetty, or by boats which cross the lake in all seasons. Slave Island is the head-quarters of the Ceylon Rifle"], [400, "376 CHURCHES AND CHArELS. Regiment, and there are some tolerably good houses, nsually occupied by the officers of this regiment. Here also are the Ceylon and Oriental Banks, the Savings' Bank, an - Council Room, where also is the Office of the Colonial Secretary. Colombo has a small harbour in the form of a semicircle, but it is not capable of admitting vessels exceeding 200 tons ; ships therefore of larger burdens are anchored in the roads. During the prevalence of the south-west monsoon (from April to October), the best anchorage i from seven to eight fathoms, with the lighthouse Itearing south by east, half-east, and the Dutch church east by south ; and in the north-east monsoon (from November to April), it is more convenient to anchor in six-and-a-half fathom lighthouse bearing south, or south-half-east, and the Dutch church east-south-east. The town or pettah of Colombo is regularly busit, and divided into fifteen streets, which run east and west, and the others cross them at right angles F_ach street has its particular name, which is generally notified in a conspicuous manner at the corner. The houses are built of cabook, and neatly whitewashed with chunam ; some of them have two stories, and all are lofty, and pit rather a good appearance. Among the pubhc buildings may be named the Supreme Court-house, the Offices of the Provincial Judge, magistrate and fiscal, a Gaol, and a Cutcherry, where the collector of the district transacts business : but none of them merit particular notice. There is also a Library belonging to the burghers, a Smasi-pox Hospital, a Masonic Hall, two theatres, and numbers of religious edifices. The Wolfendahl Church (usually called the Dutch Church), erected by the Dutch governor, Gollenesse, in the year 1746, is a lofty building in the form of a cross, and stands on a hsil in the centre of the town. It belongs to the Presbyterians, who are chiefly descendants of the Dutch, and has an excellent organ, but there is so powerful an echo in the building, that the words of the preacher are almost unintesiigible. By order of Sir Robert Brownrigg, the remains of several Dutch governors, who had been interred in the fort, were removed, with every mark of respect, and deposited in this church.

St. Paul's Church, which belongs to the Portuguese Protestants, is a neat structure, near Kayman's Gate, having been busit by sub- scription, chiefly through the zeal of Archdeacon Twisleton. t In the quarter occupied by the washermen stands their church, and besides this, there are several other places of worship in the suburbs of the town, belonging to the esta- bhshed religion ; there are numerous chapels belonging to the F\u201eoman Cathohcs, the Wesleyan Methodists, and the Baptists ; the principal chapel for the Roman Catholics is situated in the suburbs, and is called St. Lucia ; the Vicar- general resides here, and the annual conference is held on the 15th of August, when the missionaries (who belong to the congregation of the Order of St. Phsiip-Nein of Goa) are changed from one station to another ; the Wesleyan Chapel is about a msie from the fort, and in form an amphi- theatre (after the model of the Brunswick Chapel at Liver- pool), with three rows of elevated seats nearly all round. It is furnished in that style of neatness and simplicity, suitable to a missionary place of worship, and is capable of accom- modating from 500 to 600 auditors. The Hindoos have two temples, one in the Silversmith's quarter, and another in Sea- Street, but they are neither splendid nor richly endowed, as on the continent of India. The Mahomedan mosque at Marandhan presents an appearance of grandeur, but the one in the Moors' quarter greatly exceeds it in splendour, having a beautiful minaret in front. There are several bazaars, or market places, for fish, flesh, fruits, garden-herbs, &c. ; there are also two steam-engines, and several native presses, used for manufacturing cocoa-nut osi. The commerce of Colombo, both external and internal, is very extensive and increasing : \u2014 the exports to Europe are cinnamon, pepper, coffee, cocoa-nut oil, plumbago, cordage, arrack, cardamums, elephant-tusks, deer-horns, tortoise-shells, ebony, satinwood, &c. ; and the imports are cotton piece goods, flannel, hosiery, hats, wine, beer, brandy, hams\", salt- protisions, confectionery, perfumery, chocolate, preserves, snuff, earthenware, cutlery, glassware, ironmongery, stationery, paint, osiman's stores, medicines, and, in short, everything of"], [402, "378 CLIMATK. European manufacture. The exports to the British colonies consist of arrack, coffee, areca-nuts, copperas, cocoa-nuts, nookah-shells, coir, nissera-laths, beche-de-mer, shark-fins, fish-oil, ifrc, in return for which are imported rioe, i wheat, cloth, silk, sugar, spices, drugs, &c. A trade is os on with the interior, both by land and water, the Kalain Ganga being navigable for a considerable distance from its mouth. By this source, great quantities of goods are at first received, and afterwards dispersed through tho country. Some intercourse is carried on with the Maldive islands, but the cargo of the prows which arrive from thence, chiefly consists of cublemas (fish). The district dependent on Colombo, embraces an area of 1,472 square miles, with 203,242 inhabitants, of whom 65,193 are employed in agriculture, 6,060 in manufactures, and 10,388 in commerce. There were formerly many slaves; the greater part of them, however, have been manumitted by their masters, and the numbers of those who have not yet shared this benefit amounts only to 267. The climate of Colombo is considered very salubrious : the air is at all times pure and healthy, and the mean daily variation of the temperature is from 76\u00b0 to 86_^\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Rain often fasis in torrents, and is generally accompanied with dreadful storms of thunder and lightning. General Notes of the Weather at Colombo. \u2014 Mean tempe rature about 80\u00b0 Fahr.

Colombo, on the \u00ab may safely be pronounced one ofthe healthiest, most healthy, station in the island. The space ecu within what are called the Gravets, is about eight I miles, the simits being the Fort, Tankesalgail (mouth of the Kalany river), Pass Betal, Oeroe I Maligawatte, Demettegode, Marandham Ci. u planta tion, Golfoetty, and Galle Face.

The Portuguese corrupted the word into Garu ette, the Dutch, in their harsh language, called it Can.. and the British modified this into Gravets. The population may be safely estimated at from 40,000 to 45,000. Of I about 500, perhaps, are Europeans, and 2,500 are European descendants, including the military; the latter, with tin ir wives and families, number about 1,000 more, giving a total of about 4,000 whites. Of the coloured population, fully two-thirds are Singhalese ; the larger proportion of the re maining third are Tariuls, or, as they are called at Colombo, Chetties ; the rest are Moormen, Parsees, tfcc. Perhaps a fourth of the population profess Christianity ; the vast mar jority of the fishermen being Romanists of the old Goa schooL Within the last few years, a division has taken place, and a new and more liberal-minded sect has arisen, numbering amongst its adherents some wealthy and influ ential individuals.

The religionists rank, numerically, somewhat as follows : \u2014 Buddhists, Gentoos, Romanists, Mahomedans, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Wesleyans, Baptists, Fire worshippers, &c. Strange to say, the first class have no temple within the Gravets of Colombo. The fort of Colombo mounts 126 guns, and six mortars, and is at this time garrisoned by a European force consisting of forty officers, forty-two serjeants, sixteen buglers, and 780 rank and file \u2014 Europeans. The Gun Lancers, and the Ceylon Rifles, are stationed on Slave Island. The head-quarters in Colombo at present include twenty-five officers, thirty six serjeants, thirteen buglers, and 600 rank and file. Colombo in a state of siege would require 6,000 troops to defend it (if defended it could be), and could, in case of emegency, accommodate 10,000 persons. When the Governor is not a military man, the forces are commanded by a major general, who usually resides at Kew House, a pleasant dwelling on the verge of the beautiful artificial lake, which adds so greatly to the appearance and health of Colombo. Kew House was formerly called \" Blunker's Garden,\" having belonged to a Dutch major of that name. On this esta blishment being broken up, and transferred to Peradeina, the house and ground reverted to the military, and have ever since been considered as appropriated to the commander of the forces. Sir Hudson Lowe, Sir John Wilson, and Sir Robert Arbuthnot, successively occu pied the house as a msiitary quarter. The \" United Ser vice Library'\" contains a good selection of books and maps ; but within the last few years, the institution has lost a large body of supporters. The merchants and others not connected with \" the services\" could only be admitted by ballot, and as \" honorary members\" were deprived of a voice in the management of the institution and the disposal of the funds, the humiliation was too much to be borne. The merchants and other independent inhabitants seceded, and the new Hall of Commerce has a library suf ficiently liberal in its constitution to admit asi persons of respectabsiity and intelligence. Assemblies are occasionally held in the rooms of the library. The Museum attached to the Medical Library is situated in Hospital Street, and is"], [406, "382 HOTELS, SCHOOLS, SOCIETIES. well deserving of a visit. There is a large and varied collec- tion of specimens of natural history. The departm minerals is especially rich. The Pettah Library is a v . spectable institution, with a large collection of b h are now coaches every day to and from Kandy, coach between Colombo and Galle. In addition to all this, a railway is to be formed to connect, in time, the mn, and mountain capitals. The Cutcherry, or offii government agent, is about a mile from the fort, pit situated, and looking out upon the lake. New and excellent barracks, capable of lodging 200 men, were built in the time of Governor Stewart Mackenzie, and of late years a great deal of attention has been paid to the health and comt the troops. There are three or four hotels within the fort \u2014 the Royal Hotel (formerly the Government Hou- reasiy splendid one. The Lighthouse, and the lock a Sebastian's, were constructed by Sir Edward Barnes, whose statue stands facing that chief monument of his energies, the noble road to Kandy. A number of beautiful private residences have of late years been erected along the sea-shore at Colpetty, and in the Marandhan Cinnamon Garden, on which has been mapped out the plan of a future city. The Rifle Mess House on Slave Island, at the entrance to the Cinnamon Gardens, is a very handsome building. The poor are cared for. There is a pauper hospital in the pettah, a dispensary recently estabhshed, and a Friend-in -Net I 8 A school commission is energetically at work train n masters, founding schools, and preparing educational works. It is intrusted with the expenditure of from 8,000/. to 10,000Z. annuasiy. The head-quarters of the Church Mission is at Cotta, a beautiful spot about seven msies out of Colombo. There is an association connected with it in Colombo, as are also auxsiiaries to the societies for propagating tho Gospel, and for the promotion ot Christian knowledge. Colombo has recently been created a bishop's see. The scene on landing at the Custom House during business hours is one of great and incessant bustle \u2014 boats, bullocks, bandies, and coolies hurrying to and fro ; coffee, cinnamon, and cocoa-nut osi being shipped, \u2014 cotton cloth from Britain and India being valued and passed, and grain from India and Arracan being landed and measured. In 1837 was the year in which"], [407, "383 GALLE AND TRINCOMALEE. coffee-planting commenced in real earnest, and the increase in the trade of Colombo since that period has been rapid and great. The town next in importance to Colombo is Galle, or, more generasiy, Point de Galle. It is situated seventy-two msies south of Colombo, at the south-western point of the island. There is an excellent harbour here, to which all the steamers bound to and from England by the Red Sea or the Cape of Good Hope resort. The harbour is protected by a fort, a msie in circumference, encircling the town, and separated from the pettah, a part of Galle inhabited by natives and government servants, by an esplanade. There are several churches, Dutch, F_nglish, and Portuguese, at Gasie ; also a Cutcherry and an educational establishment for the orphan children of European soldiers- \u2014 the latter stationed on a hsil overlooking the harbour, and three msies distant from it. On the north-east coast of Ceylon stands Trincomalee, 180 msies from Colombo. It is the least healthy part of the \u2022island, but the excesient and protected anchorage which it possesses has led to its adoption as the naval head-quarters of the fleet serving in the Indian seas. Here also is an extensive fort, and a citadel (Osnaburg), erected on a cliff that projects into the sea. English, Dutch, and Portuguese, or more properly the descendants of the two latter, form the Christian population. Mussulmans and Tamusians make up the class of native inhabitants. Jaffnapatam is a small fortified town on the northern part of the island. The fort is busit in the form of a pentagon, and encloses the barracks, a church, and a few other public busidings. The pettah, or native town, is half a msie from the fort. It contains many broad streets, containing houses of one story with broad verandahs. The Kanda Swamy Temple, the largest and most magnificent of any in the district, stands a mile and a half from the pettah. The town of Kandy, or Sinkala, which, before the entire subjugation of Ceylon by the English, was the capital of the Singalese kings, is situated nearly in the centre of the island, in an amphitheatre formed by the surrounding hsils. The town is one of some consideration. The governor of Ceylon resides here for about half the year, occupying a"], [408, "384 KANDY AND OTHER TOWNS. pavilion busit by General Sir Edward Barnes, who was governor of the island a quarter of a century ago. All the buildings which formerly constituted the palaces, halls of audience, &c, of the Kandian kings, now do duty as go ment offices. There are numerous witoras or Kandy, for this is the chief seat of Buddhism. The prii witora is the Dalada Maligawa, near the an taining the \"most sacred relic of Bu.i Ihs encased in a golden dagoba, set round with jewels. The lesser towns or villages of Ceylon are, Galkesse, Partura, Caltura, Barbareen, Bentolee, Amblamgaddi, Ma tura, Dondra, Katragana, Ballacaloe, Point Ped Aripo, Manar, Calpentyn, Pullam, Chilow, and Negombo. These are all situated on the coast. Some are mere tishing vsilages, others small forts with adjoining pettahs, and two or three are ports which carry on a trade with India There are heathen temples, Dutch churches, Roman Catholic and Wesleyan chapels, in most of the towns. Aripo is contiguous to the scene of the annual pearl-fishery. Manar is an island, eighteen miles long, and two or three miles broad, separated from the main land by a gulf of the same name. On this island the Roman Cathohc religion was first estabhshed hy the Jesuits in 1543. In the heart of Ceylon are the cities of Ratrapara, Nu wera Ehija, Uwa, Corregalle, Potonnarawn, aud Auaradapkara. The three last were formerly cities of much importance ; now they are merely heaps of ruins, attesting the grandeur of the Kandian kings, and the devotedness of the follow. Buddha. The remains of the temples are superb. Nuwera Elia (or the City of Light) is comparatively a new settle ment formed in the mountainous part of the interior, fifty msies south-east of Kandy. Mr. Selkirk describes the air as pure and healthy, the thermometer in December, January, February, and part of March being sometimes at night below the freezing point, and in the day seldom higher than 66\u00b0 or 68\u00b0. The plain is about four msies in length, and from half a msie to a mile and a half in breadth. Invalids and others from the coast, and even from the presider India, often resort to Nuwera Esia for the benefit of air ; and several companies of the European regiments stationed in Ceylon are quartered there alternately with the"], [409, "THE PUNJAUB \u2014 THE SUTLEDGE. 385 same view. The roads around the plain are good, and there is abundant accommodation for visitors. THE PUNJAUB AND KASHMIR. The Punjaub, or country of the five waters, from punj, five, and aub, water, came under the dominion of the British in 1849, through circumstances which have been briefly detailed in the historical section of this volume. It lies to the north-west of that part of India Proper, which is bounded by the Sutledge, and was for a long period of time exclusively tbe territory of the Seikhs. There are in fact six rivers running from the north-east to the westward of the Punjaub,- \u2014 the Sutledge, the Beas, the Ravee, the Chenaub, the Jailum, and the Indus ; but in naming the country, the authors of its appellation appear to have discarded the Beas, because it has a shorter course than the other five. The Sutledge is the most easterly of the rivers of the Punjaub. It does not appear that its source has been visited by any Europeans, in consequence of their vigilant exclusion by the Chinese, within whose territory it lies. Moorcroft, the traveller, seems to have approached nearest to the source, having, about latitude 31\u00b0, longitude 80\u00b0 40', come upon the Sutoodra or Sutledge. After pursuing a very tortuous course, but in general west-south-west, to Roopur, latitude 30\u00b0 58', longitude 76\u00b0 29', it makes its way through a low sandstone range, Jhyram, and enters the plain of the Pun jaub. It is here thirty feet deep, and more than 500 yards wide in its season of greatest fulness, and is crossed either in boats, or on floats of inflated buffalo hides. Its confluence with the Beas is a sittle above Hurekee, and in latitude 31\u00b0 1 1', longitude 74\u00b0 54'. The whole length of the Sutledge thus far is 570 msies, 440 of which he within the mountains. Below this confluence, as far as the confluence of the Chenaub, the united stream bears the name of Ghara. The Sutledge is considered to be the Zaradrus, or Hesudrus of the ancients, and the Hyphasi-3 mentioned by Strabo. The Beas rises on the southern verge of the Ritanka Pass, in Lahoul, a Himalayan region north-east of the Pun- 2 c"], [410, "386 Tin: i-Hi-NAUB. jaub, and at a point 13,200 feet above the sea, iu Is 32\u00b0 34', longitude 77\u00b0 12'.

The spot from whence it proceeds is, according small lake caUed Chandra-Bhaga, or the Garden ol and in the upper part of its course the river i- Chandra. At Kishtawar, Vigne found the Chenaub flowing in a deep rocky channel twenty-five yards wide. Tin thence proceeds south-west by a very tortuous c through a rugged country to Rihursi, a distance of about ninety msies, where it leaves the mountains, and flow the lower ground of the Punjaub. It is here about 200 yards wide, deep and tranquil, yet rapid. At Aknur, about fifty lower down, it becomes navigable, at least for timber which are despatched from it down the Punjaub. Il tinues a south-westerly course to Vuzeerabad, about seventy miles lower down. From this point it holds a south-west course for about thirty msies, to Rarnnegurh, where, i middle of February, and consequently the low set 300 yards wide, and with a depth of nine feet where greatest, the current running a mile and a hall au hour. It tl pursues a south-west course for about 1 50 miles to its con fluence with the Jailum, a sittle above the fciTy of Trimo, in latitude 31\u00b0 10', longitude 72\u00b0 9'. The total length of the"], [411, "387 THE KAVEE. course of the river to this point is about 540 miles. Below the confluence with the Jailum, the Chenaub flows south west for about fifty nriles, to its confluence with the Ravee, a much smaller river, which joins it in latitude 30\u00b0 33', longitude 71\u00b0 46', through three mouths close to each other from tins place, it continues its course north-west for 110 msies, to the confluence of the Ghara, in latitude 29\u00b0 21', longitude 71\u00b0 6'. The meeting of the Chenaub and Ghara is very tranquil ; the water of the former is red, that of the latter pale, and these respective colours may be distinguished for some miles downwards in the united stream, the red on the right or western, the pale on the left or eastern side. The total length of course from the source to this confluence is about 700 miles. There the united stream is called Punj nud (five rivers), a name which it bears to its fall into the Indus. The ancient name of the Chenaub is admitted unquestionably to have been Ausines. The Ravee, or Ravi, rises in Kulu, on the declivity of a mountain called Bungall, and a short distance west of the Ritanka Pass. The source is situate about latitude 32\u00b0 30', longitude 76\u00b0. At the distance of about forty miles from the source, in a south-westerly direction, the Ravee is joined by two feeders, the Nye and the Boodhsil, the latter taking its rise in a lake called Munee Muhees, regarded as sacred by the superstitious Hindoos. Where surveyed, four or five msies from Burmawur, at an elevation of about 7,000 feet, and in latitude 32\u00b0 30', longitude 76\u00b0 30', it was found 116 feet wide. At Chumla, about sixty msies below, and south west of this place, or 100 miles from its source, the Ravee is crossed by a bridge. It is there forty or fifty yards broad, and fordable at most seasons of the year. At Bisuli, to which the downward course is about twenty-five miles due west, it has been found, early in April, about 120 yards wide, very rapid, and unfordable. From Bisusi, the Ravee takes a south-westerly direction, which it generasiy holds for the rest of its course. At Meanee ferry, on the route from Amritsir \u2022to Vuzeerabad, and about 220 msies from its source, it has, at the beginning of August, and at the time of fullest water, a breadth of 513 yards, and a depth of twelve feet, where greatest. The deep channel was between thirty and forty feet in breadth, the rest of the waterway having a depth of 2c2"], [412, "388 THE JAILUM. from three to five feet. In the cold season, when lowt water is in no part more than four feet deep. At Lahore, about twenty-five miles lower down, it is divided ind. different streams or branches. These are- rated in the dry weather, by intervals of half a mile, but in the season the two most easterly branches are united, and an expansive and rapid stream. The boats on the Ravee are the largest and best busit in that part of India Tho banks of this river are precipitous, so that it dee].. it expands. Nothing can exceed the crooked ni course, which is a great impediment to navigation. I after half a day's sasi, the traveller finds himself within two msies of the spot from which be started. The water of the Ravee is redder than that of the Chenaub. It is fort in most places for eight months in the \\ ear IV. its course south-west, measured according to the main d tion of the stream, to its confluence with the Chenaub, is about 200 miles, but along all the sinuosities, 380. This point is in latitude 30\u00b0 33', longitude 71\u00b0 46'. The Ravee joins the Chenaub by three mouths close to each ot total length, measured along the main direction of its courne, is about 450 miles. It is considered to be the Hydraotes mentioned by Arrian, and the Travati of Sanscrit authorities; it is still known by the name of the Traotee, which might easily be corrupted by the Greeks into that which they appear to have given it. The Jailum, Jelum, Jilum, Veshau, Veyut, or Behut, is the most western of the five great rivers which inti that region east of the Indus. It rises in Kashmir, the whole valley of wliich it drains, making its way to the Pun jaub, through the Pass of Baramula, in the lofty ran. Pir Panjal. Its most remote source is the head of what is regarded by some as its principal feeder, the Sidur, which rises in the mountain range, bounding the valley on the north-east, and in lat. 34\u00b0 21', long. 75\u00b0 33'; and having drained the small mountain lake called Shesha Nag, takes a south-westerly course of about fifty miles to its conlh with the Breng, flowing from the south-east, with nearly an equal length of course. About 220 miles from its so the Jailum leaves the mountains, and enters on the plain of the Punjaub. It is here a very great stream. At the town"], [413, "389 LAHORE. of Jailum, it has a greater volume of water than the Indus at Attock. It has been found, at the same place, in the middle of October, 150 yards wide, and from twelve to sixteen feet deep ; but COO yards wide at a short distance, both above and below that point, and flows at the rate of about a mile an hour. At this place the direction of the Jailum changes from southerly to south-westerly. It abounds in fish, and is infested by great numbers of croco dsies. Below Julalpoor, it takes a direction nearly southerly, and joins the Chenaub a little above the ferry of Trimo, in lat. 31\u00b0 10', long. 72\u00b0 9', after a course of about 450 msies. The Jailum is, at the confluence, about 500 yards wide After the union, the channel of the united waters is a msie broad, and twelve feet deep. The Jasium was unquestionably the Hydaspes of the Greeks. It is still known to the Hindoos of the vicinity by the name of Betusta, corrupted by the Greeks according to their usage with respect to foreign names. The scene of the battle between Porus and Alexander is generally placed at Julalpoor. The principal towns in the Punjaub are Lahore, long the capital of the Sikh sovereigns, Mooltan, Attock, Amritsir, Rawul Pindee, and Peshawur. There are a number of lesser towns or vsilages, several of which are occupied as military stations by the British troops. Lahore is a large city situate on an offset or small stream flowing from the Ravee, and about two miles east of the main stream. It is surrounded with a substantial brick wall twenty-five feet high, broad enough for a gun to traverse it, and strengthened by many circular towers and angular bastions at regular intervals. Runjeet Singh ran a good trench around the wasis, and beyond this constructed a sine of strong works and redoubts round the entire circumference, mounted them with heavy artsilery, and cleared away such ruins and other objects as might yield shelter to assasiants. The circuit of this line of fortifications exceeds seven msies. The fort or citadel occupies the north-west angle of the city, and contains extensive magazines and manufactories of war like stores, as well as the late residence of the Maharajah. There are several large and handsome mosques. The Padshah mosque, said to have been busit by Aurungzebe, or Jehangir,"], [414, "390 MOSQUES, TEMPLES, TOMBS. is a massive lofty structure of red sandstone, of greir and ornamented with spacious cupolas. It wai into a barrack by Runjeet Singh. The Vizier Kl is also a fine edifice, ornamented with lofty mil covered with varnished tiles inscribed with Ambit which are popularly supposed to comprise the v. I Koran. These splendid structures have bee. the Sikhs, who killed swine in them, and com courts into stables. Tlie Sonara mosque is an lendid building. There are besides many handsome in Hindoo temples, but they for the most part exhibit striking symptoms of the decay into which the city has fallen of the greatest ornaments of Lahore is the Shah dura, or tomb of the Mogul emperor Jehangir. It is very ext. and beautiful, of a quadrangular figure, with a minaret at each corner, rising to the height of seventy feet. The prim cipal material is red sandstone, but there is a pi ornament executed in marble, arranged in elegant mo representing flowers, and texts of the Koran iu Arabi Persian. These texts consist of a hundred repetitions of the God in different modes of expression. There is a trad that Aurungzebe demolished a dome that formerly co this mausoleum, in order that the rain might fall on th. tomb of his grandfather, in reprobation of hi. conduct; but it is believed that the building was i finished. This beautiful monument is about three miles west of Lahore. It is separated from the town by the river Ravee, which a few years ago swept away part of the wall inclosing the tomb, and threatens speedily to ingulf the structure itself. The Maharajah gave it as a residence to a French officer of the name of Amise, who caused it to be cleared out and put in repair, but died shortly afterwards. His fate was considered by the Mahometans as retributive of his in. in desecrating the sacred pile, which has since been closed up. Another of these huge ornamental tombs is styled that jf Anarkalli, a youth, according to tradition, a favourite \u2022 ofthe emperors, who, instigated by jealon ing seen him smile at a lady of the imperial zenana, caused him to be put to death, by being busit up in a brick cell, and this splendid"], [415, "391 POPULATION OF LAHORE. mausoleum to be raised over him. Unfortunately the tone of Mahometan morals is not such as to render the story in credible. Three miles north-east of Lahore is the garden of Shah Jehan, the Shalimar, or \" House of Joy.\" It is about half a mile long, with three successive terraces, rising one above the other, and contains four hundred and fifty fountains, which throw up water, subsequently received into marble tanks. Runjeet Singh barbarously defaced this superb monument of Oriental magnificence, by removing a large portion of the marble embelhshments to his new capital, Amritsir. The streets of Lahore, which are very narrow and filthy, contain numbers of lofty but gloomy houses, inclosed within extensive dead walls. The bazaars, though numerous, and stocked with profusion of costly wares, are in general con tracted and mean. There is an abundant supply of water from wells in the town, independent of the branch of the Ravee which washes the wall. The vicinity is fertile and well cultivated, being covered with the most luxuriant gardens and orchards. The great extent anel size of the ruins scattered over the adjacent country, bear evidence of the former greatness of the city. The scene presents a huge mass of serais, palaces, and ruins, wliich must be seen to form any notion of their multitude and extent. The population is still considerable, the streets being crowded in an extraordinary degree, yet in this respect, as well as in regard to trade, Lahore is greatly excelled by Amritsir, which, under Runjeet Singh's government grew up into a successful rival ; for though Runjeet Singh resided much at Lahore, where be delighted to show his state, Amritsir was both the spiritual and commercial capital of his domi nions. Stsil, Lahore, even in its decay, is a great city. It stretches in a semicircular form four or five miles along the branch of the Ravee, and yet if we judge from the ruins, it is not one-tenth part the size of what it once was. It is difficult to arrive at just conclusions as to its population, but from its extent and the multitudes which throng it, the number can scarcely be less than from 120,000 to 150,000. This, indeed, is a great declension from the amount in the time when it was the residence of the Mogul emperors, and was nine miles in length ; the population, then, probably,"], [416, "392 AMRITSIR. was eight or ten times the present number. Under the ex cellent system of government adopted since we came into possession of the country, the population wisi no rapidly augment. Amritsir is situate nearly half-way between the livers Beas and Ravee. It owes its importance to a Tulito, or reservoir, which Ram Das, the fourth Guru, or spil guide of the Sikhs, caused to be made here in 1581, and named Amrita Saras, or \"fount of immortality.\" It til forward became a place of pilgrimage, and bore the D Amritsir aud Ramdaspoor. Nearly two centum- Ahmed Shah, the founder of the Durani empire, alarmed and enraged at the progress of the Sikhs, blew up the shrine with gunpowder, filled up the holy Tulao, and causing kine to be slaughtered upon the site, thus desecrated thi which was drenched with their gore. On his return to Ka bool, the Sikhs repaired the shrine and reservoir, and com menced the struggle which terminated in the overthrow of Mahomedan sway in Hindostan. The Tulao is a square of 150 paces, containing a great body of water, pure as crystal, notwithstanding the multitudes that bathe in it, and supplied apparently by natural springs. In the middle, on a small island, is a temple of Hari, or Vishnu ; and ou the bank a diminutive structure, where the founder, Ram !' have spent his life in a sitting posture. The temple on the island is richly adorned with gold and other costly embellish ments, and in it sits the sovereign Guru of the Sikhs, to receive the presents and homage of his followers. There are five or six hundred Akalees, or priests, attached to the temple, who have erected for themselves good houses from the contributions of the visitors. Amritsir is a very populous and extensive place. The streets are narrow, but the houses in general are tolerably lofty, and busit of burnt brick. The apartments, however, are small, but on the whole Amritsir may claim some little architectural superiority over the towns of Hindostan. It has spacious bazaars, furnished with the richest wares ; it has also considerable manufactures of coarse cloths and infe rior ssiks, but especiasiy of fine shawls, made in imitation of the Kashmir fabrics, in which great quantities of goats' wool from Bokhara are consumed. There is besides a very exten-"], [417, "393 M0OLTAN. sive transit trade, as well as considerable monetary trans actions with Hindostan and Central Asia, the prosperity of the place having, in these respects, resulted from the decay of Shikarpoor and Mooltan. Rock salt is brought on the backs of camels from a mine near Mundi, about 120 miles to the northward of Lahore, a large and solid lump, resem bling a block of unwrought marble, being slung on each side of the animal. Runjeet Singh constructed a canal from the Ravee, a distance of thirty-four miles, but it is a mean and inexpen sive work. The most striking object in Amritsir is the huge fortress Govindghur, built by Runjeet Singh in 1809, ostensibly to protect the pilgrims, but in reasity to overawe then vast and dangerous assemblage. Its great height and heavy batteries, rising one above the other, give it a very imposing appearance. At Amritsir was the mint of the Sikh government. The population of the place is probably about 120,000. Mooltan, to the westward, is a great and ancient city, which, during the pre-eminence of the Sikh power, took an important part in the commercial and monetary transactions of Western India, outstripping Shikarpoor, and being inferior in this respect only to Amritsir. It is situate three msies east of the Chenaub, the inundations of which reach it. The citadel stands on a mound, and is an irregular hexagon, with its longest side, which measures six hundred yards, to the north-west. The wall, substantially built of burnt brick, is about forty feet high outside ; but only four or five feet from the ground inside, in consequence of the accumulation of the materials of older buildings. It is surmounted by thirty towers, and protected by a ditch, faced with masonry. The only buildings within it of any importance, are the battered palace of the former Khan, and a lofty Mahometan shrine. Mooltan is the largest town in the Sikh territory, after Lahore and Amritsir. The present town is built on a mound of considerable height, formed of the rains of more ancient cities. The bazaars are extensive, and are well supplied with all articles of traffic and consumption, and the shops amount altogether in number to 4,600. Its principal manu factures are silks, cottons, shawls, loongees, brocades, tissues."], [418, "394 PE9HAWER.

In the early par! of the present century, when visited by Elphinstone. il a flourishing town, about five miles in circuit, and to contain 100,000 inhabitants. Twenty years later I- Singh, after defeating the Afghans in the decisive battle of Noushera, took Peshawer, demolished the Bala Hissar, at once the capital and state residence, destroyed the fine houses of the chief Afghans,' desecrated the mosques, and, cutting down the groves and orchards about the city, laid waste the surrounding country. The subsequent and oppressions have effectually prevented its revival. The houses, busit of mud, or unburat brick, have flat roofs, on which the inhabitants spend much of their time. The whole city has rather a melancholy appearance, presenting numerous ruins of great dimensions ; the result, not so mud of gradual decay as of sudden and recent violence. numerous mosques, many built in a splendid style of Oriental architecture, have been intentionally polluted by the"], [419, "395 valley OF THE INDUS. and are going to ruin. A vast and magnificent caravansera has been converted into the head quarters of the Sikh governor. It is called Gorkhutru ; it has quadrangular out lines, each side measuring 250 yards, and contains extensive accommodation for all departments of government, as well as a spacious house for the governor. The fortress erected by the Sikhs on the site of the Bala Hissar, is a square of about 220 yards, and is strengthened by round towers at each angle, every curtain having in front of it, a semicircular ravelin. There is a fausse braye all round of substantial tbwers and curtains, with a wet ditch. The height of the inner walls is sixty feet, of the fausse braye thirty, all con structed of mud. Within, are capacious and well-constructed magazines and store-houses. The only gateway is on the northern face, which is protected by towers. The population is 80,000 ; a mixed race of Afghans, Kashmirians. and Hindoos. Peshawer was busit by the Mogul emperor, Akbar, who affixed the name, signifying \" advanced post,\" in refer ence to its being the frontier town of Hindostan towards Afghanistan. Of the northern part of the Punjaub, in the valley of the Indus, contiguous to Peshawer, we have recently derived some interesting accounts from the pens of officers, whose duty has carried them against the hisi tribes on tbe frontier. The vasiey is described as smooth and apparently boundless as the prairie, extending for miles around, and covered with a sort of coarse thick grass, with here and there, but few and far between, a clump of graceful looking trees, which relieve the monotony of the landscape, and look in their picturesque uniqueness as if they had straggled from out some neighbour ing park in order to diversify the scenery. A large portion of the vasiey is under water during the annual rise of the Indus, judging from the nature of the deposits on its surface, and the fact that nearly asi the visiages are built on artificial mounds of earth. Speaking of the overflowings and erratic course of the Indus, Dr. Dartnell, of the 53rd foot, writes : \u2014 \" It is a river of the most dashing capabsiities and extensive range. To-day gliding quietly along in a time-worn bed ; to-morrow, like an independent rider, taking a new and untried line of country as its own. I have seen it, in the course of a few months, create an island of large dimensions,"], [420, "396 RAWUL P1NDEE. clearing, when at full water-power, with a sort of we.i effectiveness, a passage for itself through the soft 'all-; rending, over-riding, and devacinating the incol sweeping ancient laud-marks, and shikar-ghars, or hui grounds, before it, to the utter consternation ol footed and feathery denizens, little prepared as tin . for such an extensive aquatic excursion ; and then after a few days' touring into the interior, flowing tranquilly through the artificial channel, as if it had never caused either turmoil or confusion.\" Rawul Pindee, where a considerable body of trot cantoned, is a large, populous town, between the Indus ami the Jailum, consisting of mud houses with flat roofs. It contains what is called a palace, a wretched building of brick, constructed by Shah Soojah, on his expulsion from Kabool. There is a large bazaar, and a considerable business in the transit trade, between Hindostan and Afghanistan. The town is surrounded by a wall with bastions, and has an old fort, on which a few miserable cannon are moo Lat 33\u00b0 40' ; long. 73\u00b0. On the road from Rawul Pindee to Peshawur, we come upon Hoosar Abdool, renowned in song and story. It is now a paltry-looking place \u2014 a jumble ol\" old build. httle apart from the road, and fulling to decay. It is densely shaded, however, with trees of ancient growth, the sacred peepul, the mulberry, the vine, and the plaintain, intertwining their foliage and branches, and affording a delightful shelter. In the enclosure, is a holy tank, square, and of small dimensions, supplied from numerous rivulets, with an exhaustless supply of clear water, and crowded with multitudes of fish. Within the building, impressed in a stone, in rude bas-relief, is the hand of Nanuk, the founder of the Sikh religion. The legend connected with this singular impression is, that, once upon a time, the prophet being thirsty and faint, solicited some water to drink, which being churlishly refused by the guardian of the stream, he forthwith placed his hand upon the stone from beneath which it issued, when the waters were instantly dried up, leaving the prophet's sign-manual impressed on the rock, as it exists to this day. The stone thus marked was afterwards rem by the priests, and placed in the wasi of the temple,"], [421, "397 ATTOCK KHTRABAD. an object of awe and veneration to the followers of Nanuk Amongst the ruins of Hoosar Abdool is said to be the \"true and genuine\" tomb of the wife of Shah Jehan. Moore has immortalized Hoosar Abdool in \" Lalla Rookh; ', but the stem reality of the scene at this hour presents no point in common with the glowing picture of the poet. Moore speaks of the dipping of the wings of birds in the marble basins of the place. The \" waters\" still remain, so true is Nature to her own exquisite relations, pure and transparent as ever ; but the basins and the fountains have all crumbled to ruin. Attock, \u2014 a fortress on the road from Kabool to the Punjaub, is thus described by the same authority. Strongly, but characteristically, set amongst bare and rugged hills, this apparently impregnable, but in reasity, weak, fortress occu pies a precipitous slope, which overhangs the Indus, its formidable chains of battlements rising from tbe water's edge, and ascending in long and curving lines of irregular circumvallation to the summit of the hsil, from whence you look down ou the dark and impetuous torrent rushing beneath the bridge of boats, or foaming in whirlpools round the jutting rocks called Tesiasia and KemaUia, the guardian genii, the Gog and Magog of the stream. Right opposite is the small and comparatively defenceless fort of Khyrabad, on the left of which the hiUs, rising abruptly in naked majesty and clothed in gloom, grimly confront the opposing fort with a sort of stern and protective grandeur, with far-off gorges and watch-towers on the highest peak, looming darkly in the distance, the whole possessing a sort of wsid melo-dramatic character, where outlawed bandit or disaffected chief might safely erect his standard. And here, doubtless, in the olden day, the renowned and chival rous Runjeet did, from his \" pride of place,\" survey with an exulting heart, and scan with a soldier's eye, the defensive points of this mountain barrier, or fixing his keen and glittering eye on the distant hsils, mark the approach of rebellious feudatory or Afghan foe. Visitors to Attock, some thirty years ago, speak of the splendour and opulence of the bazaars ; but a more miserable poverty-stricken place now it is impossible to conceive, and you shoulder your way through narrow and filthy lanes, with"], [422, "398 THE HILL TRIBES. stalls filled with Oriental rubbish, maintaining tin- m. steady restraint on your olfactories, until you arrive in a comparatively open space. On the summit of the hsil a modern hospital ha^ built, capable of containing a hundred beds, where thi sepoy may enjoy a comparatively pure at in. .1. Adjoining the fort is an extensive caravanserai or serai of contemporaneous date, said to have been emperor Akbar. Within the enclosure, and immediately beneath the parapets, are small domed chambers, not unlike. but on a gigantic scale, the spherical-roofed domiciles of the wild prairie-dog, but which, nevertheless, make \\, \u25a0 able quarters. An old inhabitant of Attock renowm his hospitasity and horticultural tastes, from a stei has produced an abundant supply of fruits, vegetabh - flowers, causing the wsiderness around the serai to blossom as a rose. The banks of the Indus, north of the Punjaub, are tute of attractions. Of natural beauties there are neither plants, trees, nor flowering shrubs; scarcely a bird, excepting an occasional flock of wild duck or coolun soaring and screaming overhead. Of the hill-tribes, the Momunds, Kyberines, Eusoofzyes, &c, who inhabit the mountains on the north-western fro of the British possessions in India, the following account has recently been given. Eternally at feud with each other, it is a singular p arity of these hill-tribes, that on the invasion of their High lands, all clannish animosities are at an end, the blood feud is forgotten, and the faction-fights which, as among Saravats and Shunavats of old Ireland, existed from gene ration to generation, are no more. A latent feeling of patriotism springs up, the beacon-fire is lit, and with that spontaneous and innate generosity of soul which binds man to man in times of danger, hands are crossed, and exchanged, which were never touched or sworn, except in deadly enmity, before. Their military resources, to be are not very great. Armed only with the matchlock and jezail, and their gunpowder of an inferior kind, they are yet, from long practice, marksmen of no ordinary skill, and when nerved as they must be by a secure site, a"], [423, "399 THE MOMUNDS. sheltering rock, a hillock, or a bush, they seldom faU in their aim. Add to this, the accompaniments of a formidable knife, full three feet in length, massive, keen-edged, and tapering from a three-inched hilt to the finest point, eked out in its execution by a remorseless wsil, and you have no despicable enemy to deal with. Arranged round thefr belts, the martial zone which they usually wear, are a reserve armoury as it were of smaller blades, deadly cut-and-thrust sort of instruments of a treacherous hue, with certain wavy lines suggestive of Damascus temper, and pistols or blunder busses of unique form, with open friendly-looking mouths, patent to the day as it were, and entreative of your con fidence and goodwill ; and pendant from the belt, leathern pouches of suspicious aspect, which are evidently less for ornament than for use. They are a fine race, however, in some respects. Civsiization has not tamed them down to the obsequiousness of air and manner which characterize a more advanced state. It is, so to speak, Nature left to her self to mould or fashion at will the character of the man uninfluenced by the conventionasities of life, and deriving its tone from tbe circumstances in which it is placed. Not withstanding all this, they possess no small share of the fraud, dupsicity, and deceit, which attach to more polished society, these unenviable qualities being unhappily common to man, whether found in a Momund hut or a Belgravian saloon. The expression of face and feature, particularly the eye, is altogether different from anything you have ever seen. It ranges abroad, as it were, sweeping the horizon with a comprehensiveness of vision that embraces objects the most remote, and with a fixity of gaze, and dilation of the pupsi, as if in mysterious communion with some unseen but influencing power, imparting that pecusiar dreaminess to the organ, so different from its vivid telegraphings when exercised on the famsiiar objects of every-day site ; and this is accounted for by the fact, that on that grand purveyor of savage life, the eye, mainly depends their subsistence. Robbers as many of them are from their youth upwards, they wsil sit for hours on an eminence in search of some unguarded Kafila or camel-herd, when swooping suddenly on the prize, they bear it with incredible rapidity to the hills. Like most savages they are not distinguished for their"], [424, "400 VUZEERABAD. gallantry to the sex, the women being emplo laborious occupations of the field, or drawing water from distant tanks. A traveller wandering through then wilds would imagine them unpeopled, the houses and villages being all apart, some three or four kos from the roads, and built at the foot of the hills, with a view to a more e | retreat into their fastnesses in the event of a forac no unusual occurrence amongst them. The insecure si the country, and indeed of the whole of A I generally, is proved by the multitude of bourges en within short distances of each other, sometimes so close that rival belligerents desirous to try conclusions may do so from the top of those turrets, without the supererogatory annoy ance of descending to the plain, either in the form of a wordy or vituperative war, or the more serious reciprocity of spear or ball. They are not very spacious, about forty feet or so in height, and twenty or thirty in diameter at the base, gradually tapering to the top, which is covered over, and with a parapet all round ; and here you can fancy the desperate robber or murderer, with the avenger of Mt k his heels, fleeing for refuge and protection. An agreeable condition of society this, but like everything else to which custom appends, it is viewed with an indifference to which their predatory habits and predestinarian ideas give i racy and strength. No man on going out in the morning can calculate on a safe return to his house, and therefore he invariably arms to the teeth, aud not unfrequently adds to his other weapons a spear of formidable size, which, however, is generally borne by the few horsemen who compose the scanty mounted retinue of a hill-chief. The only other towns worth mentioning in a sketch of the Punjaub are Jasium, Julinder, and Vuzeerabad. Vuzeerabad, or Vazirabad, is situate about three miles from the left or eastern bank of the Chenaub, here half a mile broad. Tbe country immediately about it is exceedingly fertile, and the view of the Himalaya probably tin extensive and magnificent anywhere. It is one of the handsomest towns in India ; General Avitabile, an Italian officer in the service of Runjeet Singh, hating caused it to be rebusit in the European style, with wide streets, and a handsome and commodious bazaar. Runjeet Singh made"], [425, "401 CLIMATE OF THE PUNJAUB. here a pleasure-ground, and palace of singular construction, and covered outside with rude full-length figures of the ten Gwrus, or spiritual leaders of the Sikhs, painted in fresco. Vuzeerabad is a station for troops. Jailum, or Jelum, is a town on the right bank of the river. Jailum is a town of considerable extent, and though the streets are narrow and intricate, it is a clean place. It is, however, rendered unhealthy by the inundation, which extends widely over the eastern bank of the river. The principal crops in the vicinity^ are wheat, barley, and cotton. During the season when the river is lowest, there is a ford nearly a mile above the town. The passable part of the bed describes two sides of a triangle, the vortex of which is down the river. Julinder, in the Punjaub, a considerable town near the western bank of the Sutledge, was once the residence of the Lodi-Afghan dynasty. It is situate in a tract of great fertisity, amidst flourishing orchards of mangoes and othet trees. The vast number of large and finely-built mauso leums which are around, bear evidence of its former great ness. It has a population of about 60,000. The climate of the Punjaub is of two kinds ; that of the mountainous regions is spoken of in the notice of Kashmir ; that of the plain is in general characterised by dryness and warmth. Little rain fasis, excepting in those parts extending along the southern base of the Himalaya, and where the south-west monsoon is partially felt, diminishing in its effects in proportion as it proceeds westward. The monsoon rains, however, fall heavily at Lahore in the Midsummer. The winters of the Punjaub are cool even to the feelings of Europeans. At Mooltan the thermometer, when at the lowest has been at 28\u00b0 at sun-rise. Ice forms on the water at night ; and in the-middle of day in December the thermo meter rises no higher than 70\u00b0. In January, the range at night is from 34\u00b0 to 44\u00b0, and at mid-day it sometimes reaches 80\u00b0. February is cold, bleak, frequently rainy, and always cloudy. In summer the heat is excessive. At Lahore, the thermometer sometimes rises, in bungalows and tents arti ficially cooled, to 112\u00b0. Of the system of government introduced into the Punjaub since the country became a British possession, we have the 2 D"], [426, "402 THE GOVERNMENT. following from the pen of one of the best informed advocates _>f the East-India Company.* In Bengal great mistakes were committed in the days of inexperience, and they have unfortunately so deeply pene trated the constitution of society, that the eradication of them is a task of no easy performance. In the Punjaub we were enabled to bring the experience of the past \u2014 the expe rience of failure and of success \u2014 to bear upon our operations. A Board of Administration was appointed, consisting of the ablest men in the service. A body of (well-trained) civil officers was drafted into the Punjaub, and the Governor- General planted himself at Simlah, that he might be at hand to answer every reference, and to superintend the con struction of this new machinery of government ; and the happy result of this combination of experience, talent, and energy, has been the formation of an administration, the like of which has never been seen in India, and which looks more like a picture of the imagination than a tangible reality. Among a nation of soldiers, whose valour seven years ago shook our empire to its centre, Government has succeeded in establishing tranqusisity to such an extent, that there has not been the shghtest disturbance for four years, except among the wild tribes of the mountains on the borders, who have resisted every kind of control for ages. So entirely has the British Government acquired the confidence of the military class, that the men who are covered with the scars inflicted by our troops at Ferozeshuhur, and Sobraon, and Guzerat, have freely entered our service, conquered their repugnance to crossing the sea, and have assisted in planting our banner on the battlements of Prome and Pegu. In the Punjaub our Government has succeeded in organizing a more efficient police in three years than it has been able to create in Bengal in ninety years. Dacoity and gang-robbery, which were indigenous in a country where the founder of every noble family commenced his career as a leader of banditti, have been suppressed. These crimes have ceased to appear in the calendar, and may now be considered extinct. The existence of Thuggee was discovered about two years ago, and 550 of the offenders have been tried, convicted, and * Mr. John Marshman."], [427, "403 KASHMIR. transported. A system of prison discipline has been intro duced which would not disgrace Great Britain. In lieu of the ponderous, intricate, and technical code, drawn up after the most approved model of Westminster Hasi, which is the legal incubus of the older provinces, the Board of Adminis tration have compsied a short, clear, and simple code of procedure, adapted to the national habits, which has rendered justice cheap, easy, and accessible to every class. The greatest attention has been paid to pubhc works. An engineering department has been established, consisting of 100 officers\u2014 commissioned and warrant \u2014 and it is charged with the construction of roads, canals, bridges, and viaducts ; cantonments, forts, court-houses, and treasuries ; jasis and dispensaries. Old canals have been re-opened, existing canals repaired, and a new canal has been commenced, at a cost of half a million sterling, 466 msies in length, and adapted to afford irrigation to 650,000 acres, the rent of which is calculated to add 140,000_ a year to the revenue of the kingdom. A great high road, from the banks of the Sutledge to Peshawur, has been commenced and partly com pleted, at an expense of a quarter of a million sterling, which, considering the great engineering difficulties in the way, may be considered a monument of scientific enterprise. Other military and commercial roads have been undertaken, of which 1,350 msies have been cleared and constructed, and 853 are now under construction. The estimated cost of all these undertakings exceeds 1,000,000?. The revenue survey of the whole area of the country is now in progress, the rights of the various classes of landlord and tenant have been in most instances ascertained, and an assessment, more lenient than that of Runjeet Singh, has been adopted ; whsie asi the oppressive cesses which impeded industry and com merce have been swept away, and the taxation of the country has been established on the most enlightened principles. KASHMIR. The designation of \" valley,\" ordinarily applied to Kash mir is by no means an appropriate term. The course of the Vitastha, or Behut does, indeed, form one principal valley, extending from the eastern to the western limits of the province ; but the greater part of the country is made 2 d 2"], [428, "404 THE SEASONS. up of a simsiar disposition of vale and mountain, as is observ able in all those alpine regions, and consists of mountain ranges, running mostly in parallel sines from south-west to north and east, separated by glens, which are in gein no great breadth. The chief peculiarity by which Kashmir is distinguished from the mountain countries on its confines is the rl. of its vegetation. The mountains, although for aeon able part of the year capped in many parts with snow, are coated with rich forests, and at their base is a productive alluvial soil abounding with verdure, or, where cultivated, with plentiful harvest, especially of rice. The cause of this is no doubt to be found in the humidity of its chmate, which forms a very disagreeable contrast to the dryness of the atmosphere of Ladakh. The year in Kashmir may be divided into summer and winter seasons, of nearly equal duration, the former being in general somewhat the longest. Snow usually begins to fall in December, and disappears from the warmer valleys in March. In the pass on the frontiers it remains of eon able depth till the middle of April, and lies throughout the year on the crests of some of the loftiest of chains which surround the province. The total annual quantity is so great that it bends the branches of the wild apple-trees, on which it rests for months, into a right angle with their trunks, giving them the appearance of cypresses. The end of March and beginning of April are distinguished by the popular term of dirty spring, or mud season ; and these appellations, in regard to the mire of the surface, and the rapid succession of gusts of wind and hail, with short gleams of sunshine, are wesi deserved. In May scarcely a day passes without a shower, and dense clouds constantly rest upon the summits of the mountains, exhibiting an atmosphere surcharged with moisture. The remaining summer months are hot, and bring the fruits and grain to rapid maturity. The abundant supply of water from snow and rain is cosiected into nume rous streams and lakes, the overflowing of which, with the evaporation from them, preserves both soil and atmosphere in a humid condition, more propitious to vegetable than animal life. The traditions of the country assert that the whole of Kashmir, intending thereby the principal sine of"], [429, "405 RIVERS AND LAKES. valley, was originally one large lake ; and the aspect of the province confirms the truth of the legend, the subsidence of the waters being distinctly defined by horizontal lines on the face of the mountains. It is also not at all unsikely to have been the scene of some great convulsion of nature, as indi cations of volcanic actions are not unfrequent. Hot springs are numerous. At particular seasons, the ground in various places is sensibly hotter than the atmosphere, and earth quakes are of common occurrence. The central and more elevated parts of the mountains consist of clay, whsist in the valley the sosi is a rich vegetable mould, often more or less extensively inundated from the numerous streams and water courses by which the surface is traversed. When neglected after cultivation, it throws up a thickly-matted sod of florin, or doob grass, little mixed with rank herbage, except in the immediate vicinity of unreclaimed forests. The chief river of Kashmir is the Vitastha, Vehut, the. Hydaspes of the ancients. This rises at an angle of the mountains, chiefly from tbe springs of Vir Nag, in the south east extremity of Kashmir. It is immediately joined by a stream from the south, the Kaimee river, and another from the north, the river of Branj. The Sindh, which takes its source from the Twaje La Pass, forms its own valley, and passing round the city, falls into the Behut on the northern hank, about seven kos above it ; and the Dudh Gunja comes from the south, rising, it is said, thirty kos off from the Sang-safed. and joins the Behut just above the capital. The Behut passes through the city, receiving waters from its various canals, and flows on until it reaches the Punjaub, when it becomes the Jhelum. During the whole of its course in Kashmir it is navigable, although it varies much in its depth. In December, in its course through the city, it was seventy yards broad, from one to two fathoms deep, and ran at the rate of 800 yards an hour. In May it rose twenty-five feet ; and it was said that it sometimes attained an elevation of thirty. The Weelar, Ular Lake, is of an elliptical form, and may be nearly forty msies in circum ference ; it lies about twelve kos north-west of the city. Adjoining to the latter, on the east, is the Dal, a less exten sive piece of water, suppsied by some small streams flowing down a confined valley, interposed between the vaUeys of"], [430, "406 THE CITY OF KASHMIR the Behut and Sindh, and sending off its superfluous waters by different canals flowing through the city to the Behut. There are several other small lakes within the province, as tbe Auchar, Monas, and others. The whole length of the vaUey of the Behut, constituting the greatest extent of Kashmir, from south-east to north west, may be about fifty miles ; the greatest breadth of the valley, immediately to the west of the city, is not above fifteen miles ; and in many parts it is much less, or not more than five or six. The whole breadth of Kashmir may be about forty or fifty miles, the greatest portion of which, to the north of the Behut, consists of lofty mountains and narrow valleys, thinly inhabited. The province is divided into thirty-six pergunnas. The city of Kashmir, or, as it was formerly called, Srinuggur, lies on either bank of the Behut, extending about four miles ; the principal part, the north-west, hes mostly to the north of the river : on the south-east and south of the river is the suburb of Shar Gesh, attached to a fortress of no great strength or extent ; at the same end, the eastern extremity of the city, is situated the hill called Hari ssanbat, or Kohi- Maran, at the southern foot of which is the Lake, or Dal ; and immediately to the south of that rises the eminence called the Zakhti Suliman, or Throne of Solomon. The Kohi-Maran is surmounted by a long narrow fort, beneath the bastions of wliich, in the edge of the rock, two or three large guns are mounted, which command the city. It may be doubted if the fortress itself could be furnished with cannon, as it is entirely roofed over, and presents no appear ance of embrasures. The slope of the hill is covered with houses. The Dal, or Lake, is nearly circular, but the number of floating gardens it contains prevents its outsine from being distinctly made out ; it may be about nine miles in circumference. Towards the Hari Parbot, the Dal breaks into several small canals, the principal of which is the Raiui-War, and which, flowing to the west, and receiving several smaUer canals, divides above the bridge of Naupura into two branches. The general character of the city of Kashmir is that of a confused mass of sil-favoured build ings, forming a complicated labyrinth of narrow and dirty lanes, scarcely broad enough for a single cart to pass, badly"], [431, "407 TOMBS AND MOSQUES. paved, and having a small gutter in the centre full of filth, banked up on each side by a border of mire. The houses are in general two or three stories high ; they are busit of unburnt bricks and timber, the former serving for nothing else than to fisi up the interstices of the latter ; they are not plastered, are badly constructed, and are mostly in a neg lected and ruinous condition, with broken doors, or no doors at all ; with shattered lattices, windows stopped up with boards, paper, or rags ; wasis out of the perpendicular, and pitched roofs threatening to fasi. The roofs are formed of layers of birch bark, covered by a coating of earth, in which seeds dropped by birds, or wafted by the wind, have vegetated, and they are constantly overrun with grass, flowers, and seeds. The houses of the better class are commonly detached, and surrounded by a wasi and gardens, the latter of which often communicate with a canal : the condition of the gar dens is no better than that of tbe buildings, and the whole presents a striking picture of wretchedness and decay. There are no pubhc busidings in the city of Kashmir entitled to notice, for their architectural or antiquarian merits. The oldest busiding is the tomb of the mother of Zain-ul-abddin, who reigned in the middle of the fifteenth century, and who is said to have made use of a more ancient Hindoo temple for the purpose. It is an octagonal building of brick, sur mounted by a dome of great sosidity and strength, the walls being seven or eight feet thick, but of no beauty. The shrine of Sayid AU Hamadani is constructed chiefly of the wood of the Deodar pine, and is equipped with a pyramidal steeple of timber, capped with brass. The most celebrated structure, however, is the Jama Masjid, or great mosque, which is capable of containing, it is said, 60,000 persons. The Jama Masjid consists in great part of wood, a dome, and spire of timber of rude construction, resting partly upon wooden pillows, and partly on side walls, of which the foundation and lower portion consist of roughly-hewn stones, and the upper of brick and mortar. The number of pillars is 384 ; the intervals are usually considerable. The columns are formed of an assemblage of square blocks of Deodar, about a foot in diameter, laid at right angles to each other, so that each face presents a succession of buts and sides, or, to speak more technically, a band of alternate headers and"], [432, "408 POPULATION. leaders; the blocks are probably secured together by pins, but these are not seen exteriorly. The columns are in general about ten feet high; but some are taller t: The peculiarity of their construction was, no doubt, sug gested by the occurrence of earthquakes, which are fit - in Kashmir, though not very violent. Certain it is, that although the roof and walls have been rent and >U various places, not one of the pillars appeal! to have Inn seriously injured, or to have deviated from ite original per pendicular. Such also is the durability of the timber ofthe Deodar, that in none of the columns was any vestige of decay, from exposure or insects, to be discovered, although they have been erected above a century and a half, and have received for some time past very little care or atten tion. The same valuable material is employed in the forma tion of bridges over the canals and rivers of the country. Very commonly the breadth of these requires merely a plat form resting upon haunches ; but in many places it is i sary to support the roadway by piers in the stream. In this case the piers are formed of four pieces of the trunk of the Deodar, laid at right angles over each other, and lean the centre a hollow square of about two feet. Each pier consists of a shaft, a basement, and a capital ; the shaft is usually from twenty to twenty-five feet in breadth, the height varies with the depth of the stream. The foundation is con structed on the same principle, but extends beyond the shaft, and presents to the current a pointed extremity ; it is also filled with heavy stones, to prevent it being carried away. The capital consists of five graduated tiers of beams, crossing the water line, and forming the support of the platform, con necting them at top, which is formed of layers of Deodar timbers, crossed and fastened together by pins. This con struction is so solid, that upon one of the bridges, the Zein al-Radal, a sine of shops, the best in the city, is situated The shops are busit of wood, each with a work-room and show-room, and the concourse of buyers is veiy considerable. The population of the city of Kashmir, although much diminished, must be numerous. 120,000 persons, it is said, are employed in the shawl manufacture alone ; and although this is the chief employment of the population, yet the other trades and occupations essential to the support of a"], [433, "409 LAND REVENUE. large city, must, at least, double the amount : the population of the province is estimated at 800,000. Everywhere, how ever, the people are in the most abject condition, exor bitantly taxed by the government, and subjected to every kind of extortion and oppression by its officers. The conse quences of this system are, the gradual depopulation of the country, not more than about one-sixteenth of the cultivable surface is in cultivation, and the inhabitants starving at home, are driven in great numbers to the plains of Hindostan. In Isite manner, the people of the cityr are rapidly thinning, though less from emigration than poverty and disease : the prevalence of the latter in its most aggravated forms is fearfully extensive. Accordsiig to the prevailing notions on the subject, the whole of the land in Kashmir is considered to have been, time out of mind, the property of the ruler. Of some portions of the Khalsa lands the sovereigns divested them selves by grants in Jagir for various periods ; but when the country came into the hands of the Sikhs, Runjeet Singh made a general resumption, and wrested the possessors of grants of lands of every class, thus summarily reducing thousands who had long sived in comfort, to a state of absolute destitution. The Khalsa lands are now, as hereto fore, let out for cultivation. Those near the city are termed Sai Kishti, those more remote Pai Kishti, or head and foot, upper and lower cultivation. When the grain has been trodden out, a division takes place between the farmer and the government : this was formerly an equal division, but the government has advanced in its demands untsi it has appropriated about seven-eighths of the Sar Kishti and three fourths of the Pai Kishti crop. The straw falls to the share of the cultivator ; but his case would be desperate if it were not practicable to bribe the overseer or watchman to let him steal a portion of his own produce. He has also a house to hve in ; he can keep cattle on the mountains during summer, can cut wood, and bring in the city for sale, can sesi wsid greens, butter, milk, and can support himself and family upon the wsid fruits of the forest. Still the cultivators of Kashmir are in a condition of extreme wretchedness, and, as if the disproportionate demand of the government was not sufficiently oppressive, the evsi is aggravated by the mode"], [434, "410 THE KASHMIRIANS. adopted of disposing of the government share. It is sent into the market at a high price, and no individual is ali. to offer the produce of his farm at a lower rate, or sometimes to dispose of it at all, until the public corn has been sold. A much larger revenue than that which is obtained from the land, is realized from the shawl manufacture, every shawl being stamped, and the stamp-duty being twenty-s. cent, upon the estimated value. Besides this, a considerable sum is raised by duties upon the import of wool, and a charge upon every shop or workman connected with the manufac ture. Nor are those imposts restricted to the anizans employed in the shawl fabric ; every trade is taxed, butchers, bakers, bootmen, venders of fuel, public notaries, scavengers, prostitutes, asi pay a sort of corporation tax ; and even the Katwal, or chief officer of justice, pays a large gratuity of 30,000 rupees a-year for his appointment, heing left to reimburse himself as he may. A portion of the Sinhara crop, to the extent annually of a lakh of rupees it is said is claimed by the government. The revenue is farmed, and the farmer is independent of the military governor. The natives of Kashmir have been always considered as amongst the most lively and ingenious people of Asia, and deservedly so. With a hberal and wise government, they might assume an equally high scale as a moral and intellectual people, but at present a more degraded race does not exist. The com plexion of the Kashmirians varies from dark to osive, and is sometimes ruddy and transparent ; the eyes are large and fusi, the nose is well defined, and commonly of an aquiline form. The stature varies ; but the Hindoos who have least intermixed with foreign races, are, in general, tall and symmetrically made. The inhabitants of the city are rather slight, but amongst the peasantry, both Hindoo and Maho metan, are to be found figures of robust and muscular make, such as might have served for models of the Farnesian Hercules. In character, the Kashmirian is selfish, super stitious, ignorant, supple, intriguing, dishonest, and false ; he has great ingenuity as a mechanic, and a decided genius for manufacture and commerce ; but his transactions are always conducted in a fraudulent spirit, equalled only by the effrontery with which he faces detection. The vices of the Kashmirian, however, must be regarded as the effects of his"], [435, "411 DRESS AND FOOD. political condition, rather than his nature ; it would not be difficult to transform him into a very different being. Religious bigotry forms no part of his character, and the teachers of either faith, Mullas or Pundits, are exceedingly ignorant, and possess little influence. Since the estabsishment of Sikh authority, Hindooism predominates, and the country is infested by numerous and audacious bands of mendicants. They are patronised rather by the government than the people, and the latter would gladly get rid of their presence. There seems, indeed to be little attachment of either the Mahomedans or Hindoos of Kashmir, to their respective creeds. Literature of any description is almost unknown in Kashmir, and it is not easy to discover any relics of those celebrated Sanscrit compositions which originated in the patronage of the princes of the country, whilst it was a Hindoo principality. The dress of the people, both male and female, commonly consists of a large loose wrapper and trousers, the former of woollen cloth. As a further protec tion against the cold in winter, the Kashmirians usually carry under their tunic, an earthen pot, with a small quantity of sive charcoal, a practice that invariably discolours and sears the skin, and not unfrequently occasions palsy. The Hindoo women never go vesied, and never affect concealment either at home or abroad. They had long been exempted from the cruel obsigation of burning with their husbands, the custom of which, according to tradition, was never very popular in Kashmir, having been suppressed by an edict of Aurungzebe, in 1669, and never subsequently revived. The food of those who can afford it is partly of meat, mutton of goats or sheep, which sells at about threepence per pound. Beef is not procurable, as the Sikh ruler punishes the death of a cow, capitally. The chief food of the people is vege tables, turnips, cabbages, and radishes, the Sinhara, or water nut, and rice. The turnips are purple, or reddish, and speedsiy become woolly ; the radishes are mostly white and strong ; the cabbages do not head, but the leaves are fre quently stripped. Besides these, lettuces, spinach, and other common vegetables, are in extensive use, boiled into a sort of soup, with a little salt, or even the leaves of the dandelion, dock, plantain, and mallow ; and the catkins of the walnut are employed as food, seasoned with a Uttle salt, mustard, and"], [436, "412 FLOATING GARDENS. walnut oil. Although wheat, barley, buckwheat, millet, maize, pulse, and ainacanthus are grown in Kashmir, yet tie staple of cultivation is rice. This is sown in th of May, and is fit to cut about the end of August. An principal article of the food of the comni.i. | \u2014tin Sinhara, or water-nut, grows abundantly in tin lakes in the vicinity of the capital, and especially i Walar lake, which yields an average return of 96,000 to 120,000 ass-loads a-year. It is fished up from in small nets, and affords employment to the fishermen or several months. It constitutes the almost only of at least 30,000 persons, for five months in the After being extracted from the shell, the nuts are eaten raw, boiled, roasted, fried, or dressed in various ways being reduced to flour. The Sinhara, in the shell, i at about a rupee per load. Another article of food derived from the lakes is the stem of the Nympltcea lotus. In the autumn, after the plate of the leaf has begun to decay, this has acquired maturity, and being boiled tsil tender, furnishes a and nutritious article, which supports, perhaps, 5,000 persons in the city for nearly eight months. Another, and an important use made of the abn. water surface of Kashmir, is the formation of floating gar dens. Various aquatic plants spring from the bot lakes, as water-lsiies, conferv\u00e6, sedges, reeds, &c. ; aud as the boats which traverse these waters take, generally, the short est lines they can pursue to the place of their destination, the lakes are in some parts, cut, as it were, in avenues amongst the plants, which, in shallows, are separated by beds of sedges and of reeds. In the latter places the neighbour ing farmer attempts to establish his cucumber and melon floats by cutting off the roots of the aquatic plants just mentioned, about two feet under the water, so that they completely lose all connection with the bottom of the lake, but retain tbeir former situation in respect to each other. When thus detached from the sosi, they are pressed into somewhat closer contact, and formed into beds of about two yards in breadth, and of an indefinite length. The heads of the sedges, reeds, and other plants of the float are now cut off and laid upon its surface, and covered with a thin coat of"], [437, "413 FRUITS. mud, which, at first intercepted in its descent, gradually sinks into the mass of matted roots. The bed floats, but is kept in its place by a stake of wsilow driven through it at each end, which admits of its rising or falling in accommo dation to the rise or fall of the water. By means of a long pole thrust amongst the, weeds at the hottom of the lake from the side of a boat, and turned round several times in the same direction, a quantity of conferv\u00e6, and of other plants are torn off from the bottom, and carried in the boat to the platform, where the weeds are twisted into conical mounds, about two feet in diameter at their base, and of the same height, terminating at the top in a hosiow, which is filled with fresh soft mud, drawn from the bottom of the lake, to which sometimes wood ashes are added, though much more frequently omitted. He has in preparation a large number of cucumber and melon plants, which have been raised under mats, and of these, when they have four leaves, he places three plants in the basin of every cone or niound. of which a double row runs along the edge of every bed, at about two feet distance from each other. No further care is necessary, except that of cosiecting the fruit, and the expense of preparing the platforms and cones is confined to the value of the labour, which altogether is trifling, as the work is very soon done. Perhaps a more economical method of raising cucumbers cannot be devised, and though the narrow beds are ordinarily almost in contact by their sides, yet. by their flexible nature, they are so separahle that a small boat may be readily pushed between the sines without injuring then structure, and, for the most part, they wsil bear a man's weight, but generasiy the fruit is picked off from the boat. Abundance of fruit grows wsid in Kashmir, and many thousands of acres, striking the foot of the hills, are covered with apple and pear trees, and vines in frsil bearing. They are also cultivated, as are apricots, peaches, cherries, and plums. An article of horticultural cultivation is the walnut, of which there are four varieties ; one, casied konak, is wild, the others (wontu, dunu, and kagbazi) are cultivated. The forest walnut is diminutive, with a thick shell and scanty kernel. The wontu has a large nut, but the shell is thick and very hard, and the kernel deficient. The dunu has a larger nut still, its shell thick and very hard, but in a less"], [438, "414 THE VINES AND WINES. degree ; and the kernel, large and good, is easily extracted. The kaghazi is so called from, its shell being nearly as thin as paper (kaghaz), so that it may readily be broken by the hand It is the longest of the whole, and its kernel larger and easily extracted. Its superiority is said to be attributable to its hav- ing been originally engrafted. However this may be, it is now raised from seed alone, and does not degenerate. The nuts, steeped in water for eight days, are planted in the beginning of March, and the shoot generally makes its appearance in about forty days. Walnut osi is preferred to liuseed osi for all the uses to which the latter is appsied ; and in Kashmir, as on the continent of Europe, it is employed in cookery, and also for burning in lamps, neither much clogging the wick nor yielding much smoke. It is, however, inferior both for cooking and burning, to the oil of til (sesamum). This osi possesses such qualities as fairly entitle it to introduction into Europe ; and if divested of its mucilage, it might, per- haps, compete with osi of osives, at least for lnedicinal pur- poses, and could be raised in any quantity in the British- Indian provinces. The indigenous vines are generally planted at the foot of a poplar, and run up to the height of fifty or sixty feet, bearing abundance of fruit. The grapes are commonly thick. skinned, and rather rough and astringent, but juicy. They are gathered about October, and are kept through the winter in shasiow earthen vessels, tisi the spring, when they are appUed to the fabrication of wine, vinegar, and brandy. The maksiig of wine was discountenanced under the Afghan government, but has revived under that of the Sikhs. The manufacture is iU conducted, and the Uquor is kept in bottles, which are stopped only with plugs of wood, or twisted bark, or paper. No wonder, therefore, that the beverage is indifferent ; but such as it is, it is sufficiently good to show that, with proper treatment and care, the wines of Kashmir might be made to rival many of those of Europe. The Sanjit is plentiful in Kashmir. The tree has a beautiful appearance ; its flowers are exquisitely sweet, and its fruit, by distillation, yields a beverage, which the Chinese hold to be not inferior to that of the grape. The horse-chesnut is wsid in the forest, and has not been reclaimed. The hazel is abundant ; but it is so luxuriant in the production of"], [439, "415 COTTON, SILK, BEES. wood and leaf that the nuts, scarcely of the size of peas, do not come to perfection. The elder is of rapid growth, and the shoots, when the head happens to be destroyed, are straight, tall, and free from knots. The most valuable tree of Kashmir is, however, the deodar, a variety of cedar, the timber of which is extensively employed in the construction of houses, temples, and bridges. The crocus of Kashmir has long been celebrated for the excesience of its saffron. It produces freely the third year, after being planted. The greater part is exported to Hindostan. Among other useful plants occur the Alisma plantago and the Ca/rthamus hinto rios. The animals and birds of Kashmir are much the same as those of Hindostan. The horses are small and indifferent ; sheep are plentiful, and the mutton is well flavoured ; the fat is particularly white. The cotton plant grows in Kashmir in every variety of situation : it seldom grows much above two feet high, and if taller, is said to yield an inferior article. It is sown in May, and the cotton is gathered in September and October. The cloths made from it, are in general coarse and flimsy ; but one kind, casied kodak, is of a texture particularly close, though not sine, and of exceeding durabsiity. The manufacture of cotton, however, is not very extensively prosecuted in Kashmir, and the cultivation of the plant is consequently not much attended to. An attempt was made to introduce the nankin, or brown cotton, from Yarkand into Kashmir ; but it was said that although the first growth was of as deep a tint as that of the Yarkand plant, yet the produce of the third sowing was white. It was mentioned that silk was extensively raised in Khoten ; and it appears that it extends from thence, through Yarkand and Balti, to Kashmir. In this latter country, the fabric languishes, and the quantity produced is insufficient for domestic consumption. It might, with due encourage ment, be carried to any extent. Honey is much cultivated and used at Kashmir. A provision for hives is made in building the houses, by leaving appropriate cavities in the walls. These somewhat differ in size, but agree in their general form, each being cylindrical, and extending quite through the wall. This tube is lined by a plastering of clay-mortar, about an inch"], [440, "416 HIVES AND MINES. in thickness ; and the mortar is worked up with the chaff or husk of rice, or with tbe clown of thistle-, rhiah latter, is employed also for clay-mortar in general. The dimensions of a hive are, on an average, about som diameter; and, when closed at both ends, about twin twenty-two inches in length. The walls of farm-houses and cottages differ in respect to their materials ; but are com monly constructed of rough stones, or brick, and of clay or lime-mortar, along with a large admixture of wood, in the district of Lor. That end of the cylinder nearest to tbe apartment is closed by a round platter of red pottery-ware, a httle convex in the middle ; but the edges are mad with the wall, by a luting of clay-mortar, and the other extremity is shut by a similar dish, having a circular hole, about a third of an inch in diameter, in its centre. It does not appear that there are any particular rules for the height of the hives from the ground, they sometimes being confined to the wasis of the lower basement story, generasiy appro priated to cattle in the farm-houses of Kashmir, at others are inserted into those of the first floor ; but are frequently seen in both situations in the same house, as wesi as the walls of its out-buildings. So little of difference exists betwixt the practices ordinarily pursued in Kashmir and Europe, in respect to hiving new swarms, as not to call for notice. The mineral productions of Kashmir have been too httle investigated to admit of very exact specification. Iron is found in considerable quantity, but that used for the fabric of gun-barrels is said to be imported from the Punjaub, \u2014 a circumstance rather questionable. Copper mines are said to exist ; but their existence is kept secret, lest they become to the government an additional subject of exaction; the copper used is British or Russian, imported from I. or Yarkand. No lead mines are worked, if they exist. Sulphur is an article of import from the Punjaub."], [441, "417 PROGRESS OF GREAT WORKS IN INDIA. After the first 416 pages of this book had been printed, the completion of several important measures was an nounced ; and as they could not be incorporated in their proper places without a very extensive reprint and a derangement of the entire work, it has been deemed advis able to insert them in this place. These measures relate to the introduction of the Electric Telegraph, the progress and scheme of the Railways, the completion of a section of tbe Ganges Canal, and the estabhshment of the Roorkee College and Workshop. ELECTRO-TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION. The rapidity with which the lines of the Electric Tele graph have been laid down in India, under the auspices of Dr. W. O'Shaughnessy, deserves to be placed at the head of the isiustrations of progress. Only a few months have elapsed since the distinguished Professor left England with his staffs and already have the lines been established between Calcutta and Delhi \u2014 over Raneegunge, Shergotty, Benares, Allahabad, Mynpooree, and AUyghur \u2014 in a north-westerly direction ; \u2014 between Bombay and Delhi, embracing Dhoolia, Nassick, Indore, Oojein, Gwasior, and Agra, in a north easterly course \u2014 and between Madras and Bombay, across the Peninsula, touching Bangalore, Bellary, Dharwar, Sattarah, Poonah, and Kallian. It is intended, at present, that the lines shall further run from Delhi to Peshawur, embracing m their course, Kumaul, Ambasiah, Loodiana, Lahore, Wuzeerabad, Rawull Pindee, and Attock. When complete, there wsil thus be 1,453 msies of wire between Calcutta and Peshawur; 754 msies between Madras and Bombay; and 605 msies between Bombay and Agra. The communication between Bombay and Calcutta is, of course, vid Agra and Alsighur, as, excepting Nagpore, there are no towns or stations of any consequence lying between the two Presidency cities in a direct line. 2 E"], [442, "418 RAILWAY COMMUNICATION. At the present moment (July, 1854), the only Railways absolutely open are those between Calcutta and the coal district of Rajmehal, vid Raneegunge, 190 miles; Madras and Vellore, 80 msies ; and Bombay and Poonah, 85 miles. A length of hne, exceeding that of the Electric Telegraph, is, however, in course of preparation, and when complete, the communication will be as follows. Calcutta to Peshawur ....... 1580 Bombay to Agra, vid Surat, Baroda, Dholpoor, &c. . 710 Bombay to Allahabad, vid Dhoolia, Indore, and Gwalior 750 Bombay to Nagpore . . . . ... 470 Madras to Beypore, vid, Vellore, Salem, and Coimbatore . 870 Madras to Bombay, vid Bellary, Dharwar, Sattarah, &c. . C70 THE GANGES CANAL. The main object of this canal is to irrigate the North western Provinces ; the total length, 810 miles, carries it through Hurdwar, Allyghur, Cawnpore, and Humeerpore (530 msies), with branches to Futtehghur, Bolandshuhur, and Coel, which occupy the remainder of the space. A ridge of land rises ssightly above the level of the adjacent country, and runs along the centre of the Doab, sloping down on the one side to the Jumna and on the other to the Ganges. The canal has been constructed on the top of this ridge to the vicinity of Allyghur, whence it diverges in two ch.. one to Cawnpore and the other to Humeerpore, vid Etawah. The works hating been completed, the Ganges Canal was opened with due ceremony and in the presence of a large concourse of spectators, in April, 1854, and the water admitted on an aqueduct across the Solani river at Roorkee. A more important enterprise in reference to the vast bless ings which it is calculated to confer upon the inhabitants of the districts, could not have been carried out. The canal has occupied thirty-seven years in completion. The Govern ment, duly estimating the value of the services of Colonel Cautley, who, with great energy and perseverance had brought"], [443, "419 GANGES CANAL. it to a close, caused him to be honoured, on his departure from India, with a salute from the batteries of Fort William, and published a highly eulogistic order. At the same time it put forth in English and the native'1 languages, an extremely interesting and valuable description of the canal, narrating the motives of its construction, and detasiing its probable influences on the welfare of the people and the country. After describing the canals on the western and eastern banks of the Jumna, constructed during the Mahom medan rule, the document proceeds to say : \u2014 \" These two Canals are the only large works on this river that were executed during the Mahommedan Raj, of which the remains were in existence when that Raj terminated, and the British took its place as the Supreme Authority in those provinces. Tbe Canal on the west of the Jumna during the three hundred years or more that it flowed, had been a great blessing to the country in supplying water for irrigation, but that on the east bank had been of very little use, and indeed had been abandoned very soon after its con struction. \" When the British Government found time to devise mea sures for improving the condition of its people, it gave its attention to the restoration of these ancient canals ; it con structed a great many new works upon them, enlarged their channels, so that they could hold much more water than before ; busit a great many bridges for travellers to cross over, dug Rajbuhas to carry th^ water to distant tillages, and put them altogether in a state of efficiency far superior to that in which they had ever been at any former time. Hence great tracts of country once desert and without in habitants are now filled with people, the crops that were liable to perish every year from the want of rain, are now secure, and every man on the banks of the canals can sleep soundly, without dreaming of the loss of all his year's toil because showers do not fall ; and he knows that his famsiy is sure of bread, even though the rains should fail altogether. \" But it was only in a small part of these extensive pro vinces that such a fortunate condition of security and com fort had been estabhshed. Narrow tracts east and west of the Jumna, a small area iu the Dehra Dhoon, and a portion of Rohsikhund east of the Ganges, only had been protected 2 e 2"], [444, "420 GANGES CANAL. from the scourge of drought by the rivers hi q used to supply channels of irrigation and give fertility to the thirsty land. All the rest of these rich pro. to devastation by an accidental failure of the monsoon no man could tell at what time, or under what circumstances, such a failure would occur. Thus temporary prosperity was no guarantee for continued well-doing ; the abundant har vest of this year might be fosiowed by the utter loss of that of next. From time to time terrible calamities of this class had swept over the face of these provinces, bringing in train ruin to the prosperous and death to the poor ; involving aU in the common miseries of famine and pestsience, degra dation and crime. A wise and beneficent Government pathizes with its people under sufferings like these, an': not content itself with mere sympathy, but seeks out the means to resieve them while they last, and to prevent their recurrence when happily they have passed away. The great leading motive, therefore, by which the British Government was led to sanction the Ganges Canal in the first in and to carry it forward from its commencement to its close with all the resources in men, money, and materials that could be procured, was to secure to its people in the country between the rivers Ganges and Jumna an immunity from the pains and losses that famine brings with it. This country is inhabited by nearly six millions of souls ; it is thickly covered with viUages occupied by industrious agricultural communities dependent on the soil for their daily bi Many towns and cities are scattered over its surface, and filled with active merchants, busy tradesmen, and industrious mechanics, of no mean sksil in their crafts. To preserve all these people, with their wives and children, in security and comfort, it is above all things needful that the products of the soil should be secured ; and under an Indian sun, and with Indian systems of culture, an abundant supply of water is the first want.of the zemindar : such a supply the Ganges Canal wisi bring to the boundary psilars of nearly every Rukba in the provinces. * * * * \u00bb * \"Again, whsie Government has thus thought of the zemin dars, it has not forgotten the Mahajuns.

The pro ducts of Europe and other foreign countries across the ocean wsil find their way by a continuous water-carriage to the shops and markets of the towns along the whole valley of the Ganges from the seashore to the base of the Himma layas.\" THE COLLEGE OF CIVIL ENGINEERS AT ROORKEE, Roorkee, situated about sixty msies north of Meerut, and contiguous to Seharunpore, is the head-quarters of the esta blishment of one of the greatest engineering-works of the day \u2014 the construction of the Ganges Canal. It is also centrally situated with respect to other works. It easily communicates with Calcutta ; it has Rohsicund and its works on one side, the Jumna with its canals on the other ; Dehra Dhoon and Mussooree are immediately to the north ; and it is more accessible from the Punjaub than any other place. The necessity having long been felt for some systematic training of Civil Engineers for the construction of roads and canals, draining and irrigations, some attempts were made in 1845 to prepare certain of the youths of the Agra and Delhi CoUeges for the pubsic service in this department. When, however, the first Punjaub war had been brought to a close, under the government of Lord Hardinge, and an opportunity was afforded of vigorously prosecuting the Ganges Canal, the Governor-General determined to place the system of instruction on a more extended basis, and he therefore directed the estabsishment of a cosiege at Roorkee. The motives for selecting this spot, in addition to those given above, were, that there were large workshops and extensive structures in course of formation, a library, and a model room, and a number of scientific and experienced engineer officers constantly assembled on the spot or occasionally resorting thither. The experiment has been perfectly suc cessful. The earliest pupsis were candidates for the appoint ment of Sub-Assistant Engineer, European non-commissioned officers and soldiers, intended as overseers of pubhc works, and"], [446, "422 THE ROORKEE WORKSHOP. native youths desirous of instruction in surveying, levelling, and plan-drawing. A certain degree of preparation was required of aU ; less of the third than the first or second classes. An acquaintance with arithmetic, geometry, algebra, mensuration, plane and spherical trigonometry, conic sections, and mechanics, was among the principal conditions of accep tance. The estabhshment was completed and the building opened in January, 1848. The second Punjaub war caused a temporary suspense of the operations of the college in 1849 ; but they were soon resumed, and in 1850, forty-two students had been supplied for the pubsic service ; and there were fifty in the college in 1851. Since then, the cosiege has become so important a nursery for civil engineers, and enjoys so high a reputation, that its means of usefulness have been largely increased, and still the demand for engineers, surveyors, and overseers, is greatly in excess of the means of supply. Highly-qualified men, on Uberal salaries, fisi tho offices of principal and masters ; and when the college is complete in all the branches suggested by Sir Charles Napier, tbe late Commander-in-Chief in India, it will be unrivalled One of its features particularly deserves attention. It em braces a depot for the safe custody of mathematical instru ments, and a workshop for their manufacture and repair. Hitherto such instruments had been obtained from England, and not always of a character suited to the exigencies of the service ; and when they got broken or out of repair, there was no possibsiity of restoring them. Lieutenant Allen, of the 55th regiment, engineer of the Ganges Canal Workshop, organized an establishment for the repair of instruments, and its great success formed the nucleus of that branch of the college. A museum of economic geology, an observatory for instruction, lithographic and typographic printing presses also form part of the institution. In an able paper d five of the course and purposes of the great Ganges Canal, there occurs the fosiowing description of the workshop and cosiege as seen from the canal : \u2014 \" The great mass of building occupying the high land on the right of the canal, and even stretching down nearly to the level of the valley of the Solani, is the Roorkee Work shop, or, as it might more properly from its magnitude and the nature of its contents be called, the Factory. The high"], [447, "THE ROORKEE WORKSHOP. 423 chimneys rising above the inclosure, and pouring out volumes of dense smoke, indicate the nature of the powers by which movement is given to the machinery within. A steam engine is constantly at work driving saw-mills, and planing machines, and punching-machines, and lathes, and such other pieces of mechanism as are required for the varied demands of the works. Suites of rooms are filled as with a forest of shafts and bands, and during working hours the presiding spirit is one of active energy and sustained effort. Outside the machine-shops, but within the workshop walls, the busy groups of blacksmiths and carpenters carry on their tasks ; numerous forges are blazing, and the din of many hammers is heard, whsie the quieter work in wood goes on with equal though less noisy vigour. The front building, with its clock and tower and sonorous bell, is the Model-room, where some beautiful pieces of intricate and desicate work may be examined, in steam psie-engines, iron roofs, bridges, &c, as proofs of the intesiigent dexterity at which the Roorkee workmen have already arrived. On the lower levels, braid ings for an iron-foundry, a mathematical-instrument shop, store and show rooms are rapidly advancing towards comple tion, and when they are finished and in fusi employ, the factory wsil be competent to supply many most important wants both for the pubsic service and the general coVnmunity. \" One grand object which Government has had in view in organizing this promising establishment is, that it should act as a school of industry for the native workmen, in whom we have an educational material to work with, at once plastic, impressionable, industrious, and skilful in manual labour. When such a material is moulded by minds highly trained and acting upon it with combined kindliness, patience, and vigour, the results already attained prove how much more is yet to be done. There are old habits and old prepossessions, old methods and old means to be contended with ; but these have in some measure even now melted away beneath the influence of European science, wisely and considerately dis played ; and it is difficult to over-estimate the extent to which such progress may be stimulated hereafter. \"Such is the machinery at work for the improvement of the working artisan.

The present rules allow of the absence of citil servants from their stations under medical certificate, within the limits of their presidencies ior a period of two years with retention of office, but subject to a deduction of one -third from the salary thereof for the whole period of absence. They allow a civsi servant to proceed under medical certificate to any place beyond the limits of the presidency to which he belongs, but within the simit_ of the Com pany's charter, for any period not exceeding two years, without loss of office, but subject to deductions* from the salary thereof, to the extent specified in the margin. * If salary exceeds Rs. 2,000 per month, for the first year, 1-8, and for the second year, 1-4.

After having given our best consideration to the subject, we propose to adopt the fosiowing rules in lieu of those which have been referred to. We do not think it necessary, adverting to the increased facility of communication which has been offered by the improved means of transport, and which the construction of rasi roads in India wsil further increase, to maintain the restriction as to places and geographical simits, which are now imposed by the regulations on officers absent on sick leave. We are disposed to permit any officer of this class to proceed to any place in India, in Europe, or elsewhere, as he may consider most conducive to the restoration of his health ; and we intend therefore to impose no restrictions whatever as to the places to which he may resort. 4. The fosiowing conditions must in future attach to leaves of absence granted to servants who shasi have resided ten years and upwards in India, and who may be declared by a sufficient medical certificate to require such leave for the recovery of their health. 1. The total period of absence with the privileges hereinafter Srovided, shasi not (save as specially excepted in par. 5 of this espatch) exceed eighteen months in the whole, nor shasi it exceed fifteen months on any one occasion. 2. The office of the absentee will be considered to be vacated if he shall be absent beyond eighteen months altogether, or beyond fifteen months at any one time, such absence to be computed, if he shasi to a sanitarium within the presidency, from the date of his arrival thereat ; if to any place beyond the presidency, but within the continent of India, from the date of his reaching the limits of his own presidency ; and if he shasi proceed to sea, from the date of the sailing of the vessel on which he may have embarked, from any port in India, which is not more distant from his station than the ports of his own presidency, to the date of his arrival at any port within the presidency to which he belongs, or at any other port which is not more distant from his station than the ports of his own presidency. 3. The absentee wsil be entitled to draw a moiety of his salary, and the same wsil be paid to him during such period of absence, provided that he shasi in no case draw a larger sum than Rs. 10,000 (\u00a31,000) per annum during that period. In cases in which the emolument of the absentee's office does not exceed Rs. 5,000 per annum, no deduction therefrom shasi be made for the period of eighteen months, nor shasi such a deduction be made in other cases as shasi reduce the asiowance below Rs. 5,000 (\u00a3500) per annum. 4. If the absentee be compesied by the state of his health, under due medical certificate, to remain absent for a longer period than eighteen months, or fifteen months at any one time, he will, as before stated, vacate his appointment, but he wsil be permitted to receive an asiowance at the rate of \u00a3500 per annum, for such further period of absence as shasi not exceed the entire term of three years in the whole. At the expiration of that term, aU asiowance must cease until the servant's return to India. 5. If a civsi servant of more than fifteen years' service, after having been absent on sick leave for eighteen months in the whole, or for fifteen months at one time, at whatever period of his service such"], [454, "430 APPENDIX. sick leave shall have been taken, shasi be again compcsied hy the same cause to apply for leave of absence, your I, aud those of the subordinate presidencies, may on special grounds grant leave of absence for one further period not exceeding mx month*, during which the absentee may retain his office and half hi under the limits above enjoined. 6. If a civil servant, after fifteen years' service, shall be compelled by sil health to apply for further leave of absence, he may be permitted on special grounds to obtain it, but 1ns - involve tho loss of office and salary; wo shall how.-v your government, and in the subordinate governments i . a discretionary power to grant in such last-mentioned cases a sick absentee asiowance not exceeding Rs. 6,000 or \u00a3500 per annum, for a further period not exceeding twelve months. 7. With regard to junior civil servants who may be compelled by sickness, certified in a simsiar manner, to quit their stations before the completion of ten years' residence, we have resolved to modify the existing rule by limiting the period of absence to eigl months, or thirteen months at any one time. They wisi not retain their appointments, but we shall permit them to draw during this period, an allowance at the rate ot \u00a3260 per annum, as at pi and if any junior servant absent as aforesaid be prevented by tho state of his health, under due medical certificate, from returning to his duty at the end of the periods above named, he will be per mitted to continue absent for a further term not exceeding eighteen months with the same allowance. 8. A junior citil servant hatingenjoyedeitherofthea bove-named advantages wisi not be entitled to the leave of absence provided for servants of more than ten years' service, after he shasi have attained that standing, but if after he has attained it, he shasi be compelled again by isi health to quit his station, and provided that his former periods of absence shasi have f'asien short of three years in the aggregate, he may be permitted, under medical oertint receive a further leave of absence for such a period as shall make up the entire length of absence to three years ; and during that additional period he shall receive an allowance at the rate oi per annum.

The privilege of retaining office and a portion of salary fur a limited period when on sick leave, wsil render it necessary that great attention should be paid to the medical certificates which may be produced by applicants for this leave. It is most essential to provide against any abuse of this privilege, and we desire that your immediate attention may be given to this subject, with the"], [455, "431 APPENDIX. view of such strict regulations being framed as may prevent certi ficates being obtained on insufficient grounds. You will forward to us the regulations that you may think requisite for this purpose. SHORT LEAVE OF ABSENCE ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS. 11. It appearing that the existing rules with respect to the grant of leave of absence on private affairs for short periods work wesi on the whole, we do not propose to make any change in them. The maximum continuous period for which such leave can be granted (without loss of office) wisi therefore continue to be four months, viz., one month privsiege leave, and three months \" special leave\" on sufficient cause being shown, as provided in the present rule. 12. We have on many former occasions adverted to the evils con nected with the multiplication of acting appointments, and we rely upon your exercising the most tigsiant attention that the repeated and particular instructions addressed to you from time to time upon this subject may be carried into effect, and especiasiy those con tained in our Financial Letter of the 3rd July, 1844, No. 11. 1 3. You wsil not fasi also to recosiect that it is to be held as a prin ciple not to be departed from, that no expense to Government is to ensue from the absence of officers from their stations, whether on sick leave or on short furlough on private affairs, and you wsil therefore so regulate the sums to be paid to the persons holding acting appointments, as to ensure that the aggregate amount of official salaries and emoluments shall on the one hand be appro priated to the siberal remuneration of the acting officers, and on the other hand cover the expense of the sums paid to the absentees. We desire that an annual account may be transmitted to us, show ing how this rule is carried out at each, of the presidencies. FTCRLO UGUS ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS. 14. In place of the period of three years (in one term) for which the furlough is now granted, we have determined to concede to our citil servants the option of taking a furlough of three years as at present, or of dividing the furlough into two periods, which may either he of one or two years respectively, or of eighteen months each, provided that in every such case the civil servant shasi declare on taking his furlough, whether he intends it to be for twelve, eighteen, or twenty-four months, in order that the Govern ment may make its arrangements accordingly. In case of such division, the first furlough to be taken after a residence of not less than ten years, and the second furlough after a further resi dence in India of ten years from the date of return from the first furlough. But civil servants returning on furlough to this country wsil continue, as at present, to vacate their offices. 15. Having thus regulated the periods of furlough, we shall continue to grant for those periods the furlough asiowance at present given, namely \u00a3500 per annum. 16. We shall not encourage the grant of extensions of furlough"], [456, "432 APPENDIX. beyond the prescribed period, nor shall we, upon any ground what ever, permit the receipt of furlough asiowance for any longer period than three years, under the rules above st; 17. Civsi servants who may have been compesied by sickness to quit their duty under medical certificate, before completing ten years' residence, will be entitled to receive during their furlough on private affairs, taken subsequently to their completion of that period of resident _, the ordinary furlough asiowance i annum, for three years. 18 In applying the foregoing rules in substitution of show now existing, periods of absence to the simit of three yeai medical certificate or on furlough private affairs, wsil count as service in India in the twenty-five years entitling to the annuity, the present qualification of twenty-two years' residence retained. Periods of short leave of absence on private affairs taken in India, wsil count as service and residence as at | 19. In the above regulations we have endeavoured to provide for the efficiency of the public service, whsie we have been anxious t.i extend every fair and reasonable asiowance to our servants ; and considering the present rules for the grant of leave to the Cape, &o., to admit of much abuse which cannot fasi to be disadvantageous to, the pubUc service, it is our desire that the new ruins with regurd to sick leave shasi apply to asi our servants from the date \u25a0-. promulgation. 20. We entirely concur in the opinion expressed in pars. 6 and 6 of your despatch in this department dated the 3rd May, 1830, Mo. 21, that it is advisable to prescribe, by rule, some period of Bertioe after which civil servants shall not be appointed to any new office, nor be permitted to retain office which they m I for a period of five years and upwards, and we have resolved to e.stahlUh thirty-five years as the period of service for the purpose in question. This rule must as you suggest be subject to exceptions in special cases which are to be referred for our decision. In such cases your recommendation wsil not fasi to receive our prompt consideration. The above rule may be applied to every civil servant appointed to office after its promulgation, and to the os - other civsi servant to whom it relates, at the close of five years from the date of its promulgation.
