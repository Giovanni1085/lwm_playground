In this article, I was, I be lieve, the first to show that Southern Scotland and the English Border is the chief country of Arthurian localities, and to point out the relation of this district to that of the Fingalian topo graphy of Scotland.

But in the summer of last year, 1868, Mr. Skene published his edition of The Four Ancient Books of Wales, in the in troduction and notes to which he showed that a large proportion of these poems belonged to the North, and that the historical Arthur was a leader of the Northern Cymry, or the tribes of Southern Scotland and the English Border.

One of the many indications of that synthetic, and reconstructive, rather than analytic, and destructive, tendency which marks this second half of the nineteenth century is the fact that historical scholars are beginning to look on popular legends and romances, not certainly with the uncritical credulity of the days before Nie buhr, but with the belief of finding in them such records of histori cal events as will well repay the trouble of investigating them.1 It seems desirable, therefore, in this introductory chapter, in order at once to indicate the point of view of this Essay, to set-forth, in the first place, the general relation which it seeks to establish between Medi\u00e6val Romance and Pre-medi\u00e6val History.

After such a survey of the Old Arthur land, I shall, in the third section, state the question which I propose in this Essay more particularly to consider, point-out its interest, and explain the method by which I hope to attain a definitive answer. And, in conclusion, I shall state the general subjects of the succeeding chapters. section (i) The Relation of Mediaeval Romance to Pre-medi\u00e6val History. Tlie age of the Arthurian, and other great Cycles of Eomance, is that which, in the opinion of both the great thinkers who have chiefly influenced the intellectual development of Modern Europe, \u2014 in the opinion both of Hegel and of Comte,1 \u2014 began in.the eleventh, and culminated in the thirteenth century. For, about that century, it is, \u2014 as has been conclusively shown by the researches of later scholars verifying and confirming philosophical speculation,3 \u2014 that the distinctively Christian, or Catholico-Feudal orgiinization of so ciety attains its highest perfection ; that the Crusades afford their brightest examples of heroism, and chivalric magnanimity ; that Art achieves its most original, most variedly beautiful, and majestic triumphs; and that Literature presents, in the Eomances, at once the highest, and most popular Ideals of the Age. And thus culmi nating in tho thirteenth century, the Medi\u00e6val Age may, as a great historic period, be defined as the five centuries from the eleventh to the fifteenth, inclusive. With the sixteenth century begins our * \" J'uime surtout qu'il (Hegel) ait tu que le monde n'a 6t6 vraiment chretien qu'nu onzi&me siecle.\" lettre d'A.

But for a thousand years before the opening of the Medi\u00e6val Age, Christianity had been working in the European world, completing the destruction of the antique system of thought and of society, and laying the foundations of a new world-system. The first half of this millenium I would distinguish as the Imperial Age. For it is the age of the Eoman Empire of the East and West. It is the age also of the Apostles, the Fathers, and the Martyrs of Christianity. And the latter five hundred years of this first millenium of the Christian era I would distinguish as the Barbarian, or Pre-medi\u00e6val Age. The Eoman Empire no loDger extends its sway over Northern and Western Europe ; and the various tribes of barbarians, \u2014 Celtic and Teutonic, \u2014 are engaged in perpetual conflicts,- \u2014 miserable and disheartening when looked at in their details, but, regarded as a whole, found to be in their great issues conflicts that laid the foundations of the nationalities of a New Europe.4 For, by the end of this age, there has been constituted in France the first of the Eomanic or Neo-Latin nationalities; in England, a preponderatingly Teutonic \u2022 and, in aScotland, a predominantly Celtic nationality.5 And ' Compare Ozanam, Civilization au Cinquiime Siecle t. II. p. 315 et seq. 6 As a writer of such authority as Momcasen has said \" Solche Eigenschaften guter Soldaten und sehlechter Burger erklaren die geschichtliche Thatsache, dasg die Kelten alie Staalen er-vliitUrt und keinen gegriindet huben\" (Romische Geschichtt B. II., K, IV., b. I., s. 329, English Translation, v. I., p. 359), one would not be justified in thus speaking of the consolidation ofthe tribes of North Britain into a predominantly Celtic nationality without, al loast, briefly referring to one's proofs. These are to be found in the unquestionable facts, firstly, that, both in number, and in entent of territory occupied, Celts, \u2014 Cymry, Picts and Scots, or Gael, \u2014 were the chief basis of the Scotish nationality ; secondly, that it was by one of the"], [22, "[Ch. I. 4 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. as this Pre-medi\u00e6val Age was occupied by the elemental wars of the tribes ultimately consolidated in these three national unities ; so, the Medi\u00e6val Age was filled with the contests of these nations with each other, and with the rising nationalities around them. But, on taking a wide view of European history, we shall see these Medi\u00e6vaal wars preparing, as all conflict does, in fact, prepare, a higher unity. And, as the name of Scotland is first heard towards the close of the Pre-medi\u00e6val wars of the tribes of North Britain ; so, the idea of Europe emerges from the Medi\u00e6val conflict of the races of this Asiatic promontory. Now that which, I trust, will be found the most clearly estab- lished, as it is the most general view in this Essay maintained, is Celtic tribes, the Scots, namely, or Gael, that, not only all the other Celtic elements of the population, bat the Saxon element also, was, towards the end of the Pre-medi\u00e6val age, united under one monarch, whose dynasty, or the heirs of whose dynasty, lost their sovereignty only with the fall of the Stuarts, and the substitution of the present German Family ; and, thirdly, that, in the opinion of the most competent authorities, not only were the tribes of North Britain thus united into the Scotish nationality by a Celtic race ; not only, that is, have wo here, at least, an exception to wbat Mommsen declares thus absolutely to be an historical fact, \" that the Celts have shaken all states and have founded none,\" but the language of Scotland, both in the Highlands and Lowlands, except a narrow strip of sea-coast, was, at least till the reign of Malcolm Caenmore (1058-1093), and the opening of the Medi\u00e6val Age, Gaelic. See Innes, Sketches of Early Scotish History, pp. 85-6; compare also Robrhtson, Scotland under Her Early Kings, vol. I., pp. 125, et seq. and v. II., pp. 142-3, and p. 374 ; and Tytler, History of Scotland, v. II., p. 188, et seq. That, during the Medi\u00e6val Age, a Teutonic dialect, allied to the English, took the place of Norman-French, and of Gaelic, at tbe Court, and further extended itself in the Lowlands, was due to many causes. Among these, may, for instance, be named, the marriage of Malcolm Caenmore with the sister of Edgar Atheling, and the encouragement thence given to the settlement in Scotland of Saxon refugees from the Norman conquest; the policy of the Scotish monarchs generally in en- couraging the settlement both of Saxons and Normans, as allies against their own turbulent subjects ; and tho naturally preponderating influence of the inhabitants of eea-coaste. Sec note 16 infid p. 27. And yet to this hour one may, in a day's journey from such a vast centre of an English-speaking population as Glasgow, find the simplest English question answered with \"No English!\" Celts have, therefore, once, at least, succeeded in founding, though not in long maintaining, a state with a purely Celtic organization and language. But have Saxons founded or long maintained a State with a purely Teutonic organization ? These current generalizations about the Celts will seldom bear being strictly examined.

(.).] 5 THE OLD ARTHUR-LAND. that in the Eomances of the Medi\u00e6val Age, and more particularly in those of the Arthurian Cycle, there is not only a mythological element, as I hope in another Essay fully to show ; but that there is a very important historical element ; a record, legendary indeed, and hardly to be deciphered for its extraordinary flourishes, but still a record of certain real, and not purely fictitious cha racters, incidents, and conflicts of the Premedi\u00e6val Age. And if this should be established, we shall certainly have a result which will reward the labour of this investigation of Arthurian localities ; a result not only for the general Medi\u00e6val history of European literature ; but for the Pre-medi\u00e6val history of that particular region in which our researches may localize the events from which the historic element of the Arthurian Eomances is derived. Of no slight historic interest can it be to show that Arthur and Merlin are neither purely mythic personages, nor mere poetic creations ; but that the legends and traditions that the Medi\u00e6val trouveres and troubadours wrought-out into their mag nificent romances, were records of actual Pre-medi\u00e6val per sonages, whose characters and histories had forcibly impressed the popular imagination ; and that the country where the heroic Arthur fought, and the forests where the wild Merlin wandered, can be now, on no doubtful evidence, pointed-out. The one, no doubt, was but a leader of barbarians, and the other but a barbarian compound of madman and poet, of prophet and bard. But it is these very cir cumstances that give their characters an historic interest in relation to their Medi\u00e6val idealisation. And not only shall we thus see the Medi\u00e6val connected with the Pre-medi\u00e6val Age in the relation between the Eomantic Ideals of the one, and the Traditional Heroes of the other ; but, in showing that the Medi\u00e6val Eomances had an historic element, and that the age and country of those characters who lived-again in the Eomantic Ideals, can be now assigned ; we shall connect also with that Pre-"], [24, "6 [Ch. I. ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. medi\u00e6val, our present Modern Age. For there are many indica tions, not only in the needs of the time, and in the characteristic advantages of the Arthurian Mythology ; but in the actual fact of the use already made of it by so many modern poets ; 6 that the Medi\u00e6val Eomances of King Arthur will be the chief formal material of the New Poesy. To show, therefore, that these Medi\u00e6val Eomances had in them a definite historical element, is to give that New Poesy also an historic basis ; to discover for its characters and incidents \" a local habitation ;\" and to connect by a new bond the Present, not only with the Medi\u00e6val, but with the Pre-medi\u00e6val Age. Another, a still higher, a moral interest this investigation seems also to me to have ; and I trust that, before entering upon it, I may be pardoned for alluding for a moment to these higher, these moral aspects of our subject Let me but desire my readers to reflect how the establishment of such a relation, as will here occupy us, between Medi\u00e6val Eomance and Pre-medi\u00e6val history, brings home the great idea of the continuity of human development ; how it shows the traditions of the barbarian conflicts of one age taken up by the next, and used as the formal material of the creations of a magni ficent poesy ; how it shows the rude lives of an earlier period living again in the ideal heroes of succeeding ages ; how it shows that, though the tribes of whom these traditions are the historic memo rials, were conquered, absorbed and extinguished as separate poli tical organizations, yet they died not ; how it shows that, in the suc cession of Humanital, as in the sequence of Natural phenomena, there is, in fact, no such thing as Death ; that there is but Decease only, and Transformation. And thus it is but a great historio truth mythically expressed, that legend of Merlin's prophecies from his Tomb. \" Lady,\" replied Merlin, \" the flesh upon me will be rotten \u2022 I need here only recall Mr. Tennyson's Tdijlls of the King, Mr. Arnold's Tristram and Iseult, Mr. Morris's Defence of Guenivere, Edgar Quinet's epic Merlin, and Richard Wagner's \"Poemes d'Opera,\" Lohengrin, and Ib-islan et Iseult."], [25, "S.

Let us now proceed to our preliminary survey of the traditional Aithur-laad. Localities with Arthurian names, or Arthurian tradi tions attached to them, are to be found, in greater or less abundance, in Scotland, in Wales, Somersetshire, and Cornwall, and in Brittany. In Scotland, there is still pointed out in the churchyard of Meigle, on the holders of Perthshire and Forfarshire, an ancient sculptured stone said to mark \" Ganore's Grave,\" or the tomb of Guenivere. Arthur's Seat still connects Edinburgh with the mythic hero's fame. And at Drummelziar on the Tweed is still to be seen the perennial thorn that has not yet ceased, in an offshoot at least, to bloom over the grave of Merlin. How many more Arthurian localities are to be found in Scotland will, in the third chapter of this essay, be shown in detail. Postponing, then, any further notice of the Arthurian localities of Southern Scotland, I shall at once proceed to those of Western England. In North Wales, between Mold and Euthin, near Colomendy Lodge, in Flintshire, is Maen Arthur, a stone which, in popular fancy, bears an impression of the hoof of the hero's steed. Between Mold and Denbigh is Moel Arthur, an ancient British fort, defended by two ditches of great depth. Near Denbigh, \"there is, in the Paroch of Llansannan in the Side of a Stony Hille, a Place wher there be 24 Holes or Places in a Eoundel for Men to sitte in, but sum lesse, and some bigger, cutte oute of 7 Froplucics de Merlin, F. 76. 8 Abiosto, Orlando lurioso, c.

Kiddes use ther communely to play & skip from Sete to Sete.\"9 The remains of what would appear to have been a Eoman Camp overlooking Eedwharf Bay, or Traeth Coch, in Anglesea, is locally called Burdd Arthur, or Arthur's Bound Table. Also in Anglesey, in the grounds of Llwydiarth, a seat of the Lloyd family, is a famous Maen Chwf, or rocking stone, called Arthur's Quoit. In Caernarvonshire, to the south of Snowdon, \"over looking the lower end of Llyn y Ddinas, is Dinas Emrys, a singular isolated rock, clothed on all sides with wood, containing on the summit some faint remains of a building defended by ramparts,\" with which a legend of Merlin and Vortigern is connected : \u2014 \" And from the top of Brith, so high and wondrous steep, Where Dinas Emris stood, shewed where the serpents fought, The White that tore the Red ; from whence tbe prophet wrought The Briton';; sad decay then shortly to ensue.\" 10 In this same county, at Llyn Geirionydd, as also at Aberystwith, and other localities on the Cardiganshire coast, Taliessin, another of the four great bards of the sixth century, is said to have been found on tho shore, like Moses in the bulrushes, by Gwyddno Garanhir.\" And, on the south of Caernarvon Bay, is Nant Gwrtheryn, the Hollow of Vortigern, a precipitous ravine by the sea, said to have been the last resting place of the usurper, \u2014 so, at least, he is repre sented in the Romance of Merlin,11 \u2014 when he fled to escape the rage of his subjects on finding themselves betrayed to the Saxons. In Merionethshire, there is a river with the Arthurian name of Camlan flowing into the Eden. And the Church of Llanover, near the Bala Lake in this county, is' said to have been the burial place of ' Leland, Itinerary, v. V. pp. 62, 63. 10 Drayton, Poly.Olbion, Song the Tenth. Works, v.

To the address of this bard to his Crutch Mr. Arnold refers in illustration of \" the Titanism of the Celt, his passionate, turbulent, indomitable reaction against the despotism of fact.\" 13 \" 0 my Crutch ! is it not the first day of May ? The furrows, are they not shining ? The young corn, is it not springing ? Ah ! the sight of thy handle makes me wroth.\" In South Wales, near the turnpike road from Beynoldstone to Swansea, on the north slope of Cefn Bryn, there is the famous cromlech called Arthur's Stone. About five miles to the south of Brecon on the Usk, rise the twin peaks of the Beacons called Arthur's Chair. On an eminence adjoining the park of Mocras Court, in Brecknockshire, is a large and peculiar kind of British cromlech, called Arthur's Table. And at the once famous city, now the decayed village, of Caerleon upon Usk, \u2014 the Isca Silurum of Antoninus, where the second Augustan Legion was, during a long period, in garrison, \u2014 are the remains of a Eoman Amphitheatre, in a bank of earth heaped up in an oval form sixteen feet high, and now also called Arthur's Bound Table. Some four miles from Caer marthen, itself said to be derived, but quite erroneously,14 from Caer Merddin, the city of Merlin, is Merlin's Grove, and Hill. And on the bank of the Towy, within the domain of Dynevor Park, Spenser has placed the cave of Merlin : \u2014 \"There tbe wise Merlin, whilom wont, they say, To make his wonne low underneath the ground, In a deep delve far from the view of day, That of no living wight he might be found, When so he counselled with his sprights around. 13 On the Study of Celtic Literature, p 155.

Antique report makes this one of Arthur's places of his Bound Table.''18 Cadbury is mentioned in old records under the name of Camelot, a name still perpetuated in the adjoining villages of Queen's Camel and West Camel. In the fourth ditch is a spring called King Arthur's Well. And the relics found in the fortress prove it to have been occupied by the Eomans, though, as we have seen, tradition assigns its origin to King Arthur, who, in the opinion of Camden, probably fought a battle with the Saxons in this neighbourhood. The other famous Arthu rian locality of Somersetshire is Glastonbury, which, once encircled by the arms of the Brue, or Brent, formed the Eoman Insula Avalonia, or Isle of Avalon. >\u00bb \" Faerie Queene,\" iii. 3.

Not far from Camelford is a little entrenchment, known as Arthur's Hall. On the Camel or Alan (Crum hayle, crooked river) the final battle is said to have been fought between Arthur and his rebellious nephew, or rather, bastard son, Mordred. \" Let Camel of her course & curious windings boast, .... her proper course that loosly doth neglect, As frantic, ever since her British Arthur's blood, By Mordred's murtherous hand was mingled with her flood.\" \" Between Camelford and Launceston, on Wilsey Downs, is Warbelow Barrow, an ancient fortification of considerable size, in the centre of which is a large mound, popularly called King Arthur's Grave. At Slaughter Bridge, between Camelford and Tintagel, on the Bristol Channel, a stone, with the hero's name on it, is pointed out Tintagel, though in the romances of Sir Tristrem it is made the Castle of King Mark, is the reputed birthplace and residence of Arthur.24 Some of the rock basins in the slate of the promontory are fantastically called King Arthur's Cups and Saucers ; and south of Tintagel, near St. Colomb, is the eminence of Castle an Dinas, or the earth -fort, crowned with an elliptical doubly entrenched camp of six acres, which tradition affirms to have been the hunting-seat of King Arthur, who, according to the legends, chased the wild deer on the Tregon Moors.

And hence the first result of a general inquiry into Arthurian topography is the outlining of a continuous region from the Grampians, in Scotland, to the Loire, in France, distinguished by localities with Arthurian names, or Arthurian tra ditions attached to them. This region may be briefly described as including what is now the south of Scotland, the west of England, and the northwest of France.27 And the question which I propose in this Essay mainly to consider, and, if possible, definitively to answer, is : \u2014 Which of these three divisions of the old Arthur-land, that of Scotland, of England, or of France, was the original birth land of Arthurian tradition ? To show the importance of this question, and to excite an interest in its solution, I trust that the following brief remarks will be suffi cients In the first place, then, it opens up to the philosophic his torian the general question of the origin of traditional topographies ; a question which has not only not been, as yet, so far as I am aware, treated scientifically, except with respect to some of the Syrian localities of Christian tradition; but which is connected in its general bearings with all those other questions of origin which so directly affect the validity of popular religious beliefs. But, farther, it is an inquiry, the result of which will be to draw back tlie veil from ancient centuries of the history of mankind, and to connect, with still existing monuments, long past events of that struggle for existence, which, of all others, must chiefly interest us of the human race. But, besides these general results, the inquiry on which we would now enter, ought, at length, to present us with the local historical 27 Arthurian traditions, it must, however, be noted, attaoh also to some places beyond the limits of the region thus described, and rather in the south, than the west of England. For instance, \" And for great Arthur's soat, her Winchester prefers, Whose old Round Table yet she vaunteth to be hers ; \" sings Drayton iu thc Second Song of the Poly-Olbion, so often above quoted (Works, v. 11. p. 691)."], [33, "S.

Yet, further, if I am right in the conclusion that the two chief elements determining the form of the Medi\u00e6val Arthurian Eomances are to be found in historical events of the Premedi\u00e6val Age, and in Celtic myths, which may bo traced back to the earliest forms of speech distinctive of the Indo-European Eaces,29 this inquiry will appear as the necessary preliminary to the investigation of the Arthurian branch of a mythology which is second in interest only to that which has gathered round the his torical facts of Christian tradition. And yet, further, if, as seems probable, not only from their special characteristics, but from the use increasingly made of them, the Arthurian Eomances are des tined to become the chief formal material of European poesy ; such an inquiry as the following should, in determining the ori ginal locality of Arthurian tradition, fix also the site of a new classic land, in which, as of old, in Greece, the creations of poesy in all its different forms, may have a common \" local habitation,\" and gain all the advantages, thus only given, of vivid realization in the popular fancy. For those to whom the force of these considerations in illustra tion of the importance of the question above proposed, and the interest of its solution, may not be at once apparent, let me add, what may to some antiquarians be the most stimulating circum stances of all, the facts, simply, that this question has been eagerly discussed ; that the answer here given, though it has been suggested, cannot be held to have been hitherto proved;29 and that 28 In the same way as tbe linguistic origin of the Classic myths has been explained by modern philology.

Compare also bis introduction to Sir Tiislnm, pp. xxxiv-viii. ; and to Thomas the Rhymer, Part II. in Minstrelsy of the Scotish Border. A writer in the Gentleman s Magazine of 1842 was, however, the first, I believe, distinctly to maintain that \" tbe seat of Arthur's power was adjacent to tbe Saxon settlement of Lothian ; \" and that \"in connection with that settlement his victories are recorded by Nennius.\" And he adds that tbe mistake of assigning to Arthur a kingdom in the south-western extremity of the island \"was possibly confirmed by the casual similarity of name between Arthur's real subjects in the north, and those assumed for him in the Cornish promontory, the former bearing the designation of Damnii, the latter of Dumnonii\" v. XVII. p. 486. But the incompleteness of the evidence advanced in support of this conclusion was probably the reason of its attracting but little attention. Mr. Nash also asserts, but does not even attempt to prove a theory similar to that in this essay maintained. \" The original locality,\" he 6ays, \"ofthe traditions which have furnished the groundwork of these world-renowned romances (of King Arthur) is probably the Cumbrian region taken in its widest extent from the Firths of Forth and Clyde southward and west ward along the holders of the Northumbrian kingdom, in which the famous exploits of the British Cymric struggle with the Northumbrian Angles became the theme of a native minstrelsy, transplanted into Brittany by the refugees from the Suxon conquest, and moulded into the romances with which we have been made acquainted by the Norman trouveres.\" Merlin the Enchanter and Merlin the Bard, p. iv.

That method has consisted, first, in examining the results of the modern scientific criticism of Celtic history, political, and literary, in as far as these results more particularly bear on the definite localization of events which may have been the origin of those traditions which, in our investigation of Arthurian topography, we have found to be so widely diffused. Our deduction from these critical results has been that it was in Southern Scotland, and neither in Western England, nor in North-western France that the .Arthurian traditions, still attached to so much of the topo graphy of all these districts, originated. This deduction, however, standing alone, could hardly in any case, and especially considering the scantiness of the materials on which it is founded, be received as satisfactory scientific proof of the historical origin of Arthurian localities. And hence the necessity of an inductive verification of our deductive theory. How was such a verification to be gained ? By the second step of the method which has guided these re searches. This was founded on the postulate, or assumption, that, except special reasons could be shown to the contrary, that district in which the Arthurian traditions had their local historical origin would be found to be the chief country of Arthurian localities. I therefore noted, in the course of a great many perambulations of the region thus critically indicated, all the localities there to be found with Arthurian names, or Arthurian traditions attached to them. The general result of these journeys was a determination of that district of Southern Scotland and the English Border, in which the Arthurian traditions had, according to our critical theory, had their local origin, as, to this day, the chief country of Arthurian localities. This, on the principle above stated, I seemed justified in regarding as the required inductive verification. And thus it is in the fact of the accordance of the deduction from the results of literary and i"], [36, "18 [Ch. I. ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. historical criticism, with the induction from the results of topo graphical investigation, that the main proof of the thesis in this essay maintained, namely, that Scotland is the original seat of Arthurian tradition, consists. But our conclusions both as to the historical origin and the chief country of the Arthurian localities, having been found- to be thus accordant and mutually confirmatory in their indication of Southern Scotland, it did not appear that our investigation would be scienti fically complete without an examination of the relations of the Scotish Arthurian topography to that Fingalian topography which has been long known to be possessed by Scotland, as well as Ireland. Nor will, I trust, this third step in our investigation of Arthurian localities be thought other than a necessary part of our discussion of Arthurian localities, if, instructed by the results of that most powerful of modern scientific instruments, the Compara tive Method, one has been led to see how necessary is the study of the Fingalian Myths in the scientific investigation of the Arthurian Eomances; if one considers the importance of the fact that the local relations, discovered in Scotland, of Arthurian to Fingahan tradition, are nowhere else to be found ; and if, especially, I am successful in showing in these unique relations a confirmation of the theory here maintained as to the original birthland of the traditions of King Arthur. Having thus, in this first, or introductory chapter, set- forth the general relation which I seek to establish between Medi\u00e6val Eomance and Pre-medi\u00e6val History ; having briefly noted the chief traditional localities of the Old Arthur-land, considered as a continuous European region; and having stated the method by which I propose to determine the special district in which Arthurian traditions originated, the subjects of the succeeding chapters will be as follows. In the next, or second chapter, those results of the"], [37, "S.

In the third chapter, a summary account will be given of the very numerous perambulations of the Arthurian district of Scotland, from the result of which arises the verifioative induction as to the chief country of Arthurian localities. In the fourth chapter it will be shown how variously suggestive, and confirmatory of the conclu sions of the foregoing chapters, are those Fingahan relations of tho Arthurian topography of Scotland, presented by the examination of Pictish memorials. .And, fifthly, I shall, in conclusion, briefly advert to considerations that should seem to give more than merely antiquarian interest to this discovery of the true, or original country of Arthurian tradition. Let me now, then, endeavour to show that that part of those far Islands of the West where terminated, until their new exodus in the present age,30 and where were reunited, at length, the two great northern and southern streams of Celtic migration from the Asian birthland of the Aryan tribes ; \u2014 that part of the Old Arthur-land in which the Pre-medi\u00e6val events which are the chief historical bases of the Arthurian Eomances of the Medi\u00e6val trouveres and trouba dours actually occurred, and where the tradition of these events has to this day the most numerous topographical monuments ; \u2014 is that district of the largest of the British Isles which, bounded on the north by the chain of the Grampians, and on the south by the Tyne and the Derwent, was formerly known as Y Gogledd, or \" the North,\" and which I would distinguish as Arthurian Scotland.31 M See Bory (Lord), Exodus of the Western Nations, 31 This term is thus used to include part of what is now England. But, I think, justifiably : not only because it is a more convenient, though, perhaps, les3 exact term than \" Southern Scotland and the English Border ;\" but because the dominion ofthe early Scotish kings extended, though precariously, beyond the present border; and because Cumberland and Northumberland were not finally annexed to the Crown of England till the third of Henry II.

Let me, now, \u2014 but without any assumption, in so obscure a matter, of absolutely proving my case, \u2014 bring forward in due order those results of critical and topographical research which appear to me to support each other in the conclusion that Southern Scotland and the English Border is the true historical region of the Old Arthur-land. CHAPTEE H. THE HISTORICAL ORIGIN OF ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES AS DEDUCED PROM THE CRITICISM OF CYMRIC HISTORY. In attempting to answer the question before us as to the birth land of Arthurian tradition, I shall, in this chapter, briefly state those residts of a critical examination of Cymric history, political and literary, from which we seem justified in concluding \u2014 first, that the Arthur of the earliest historical sources, and of the earliest bardic poems, was a leader of the northern Cymry, and, hence, that the North was the cradle of Arthurian story ; secondly, that, in the history of the northern Cymry, there were conditions inimical to the importation and preservation of Arthurian traditions, supposing they did not originate in the North in an historical Arthur ; and thirdly, that, on the other hand, in the history of the southern Cymry, there were conditions in the highest degree favourable to the importation of Arthurian traditions, supposing they had in the North, their historical origin- It is but just to add that I shall found these conclusions principally on the results of the admirable Celtic researches of Mr. Skene.1 section (i). Direct Indications of the North as the Historical Birthland of Arthurian Ti adition. First, then, let me state those critical results which directly 1 Chiefly as contained in his Introductions, or rrefuces, to The Four Ancient ISoohs of Wales, The Book of the Dean of Lismore, and The Chronicles of the Picts ai.d Scots."], [39, "S. (i).] CYMRIC HISTORY. 21 indicate the North as the birthland of Arthurian tradition. This I shall do in the order of the questions that logically arise in an investigation of Cymric history. The first of these is as to the number and character of the earliest authentio sources of such history ? Besides tho old Eoman and Saxon authorities, these sources are but three in number \u2014 first, the Historia and Epistold of Gildas which, from internal evidence, appears to have been com posed in the year 560 ; secondly, the works which go under the name of Nennius, of which the first would appear to have been written in the seventh century, soon after the Origines of Isidore of Seville who died in 636, and the others in the succeeding centuries, down to 1072 ; thirdly, the Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales, of which the oldest, the Laws of Howel dda, are of the tenth century. We have next to inquire what, so far a3 we can gather it from these ancient historical sources, was the distribution of the Cymric population in the sixth century, the earliest of which we find native historians ? And we thence discover that, instead of the Cymry being, as commonly supposed, confined to Wales and Corn wall, with the Picts and Scots occupying the country to the north of the wall between the Tyne and the Solway ; the Cymry possess the whole of the country from the Dee and the Humber to the Firths of Forth and Clyde, except the east coast from the Tyne to the Esk, where the Saxons are gradually encroaching, and the district of Galloway on the north of the Solway, between the Nith and Loch Eyan, where the Picts still maintain themselves. But while we are thus shown the Cymric population extending much further north than we have hitherto generally believed, we find also that, instead of Wales being exclusively occupied by Cymry, its western seaboard is in the possession of the Gwyddyl, or Gael, (Scots from Ireland?) a line drawn from Conway, on the north, to Swansea on the south, separating the two (Celtic) races of the"], [40, "22 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. [Ch. II. Gwyddyl and the Cymry, on the west and on the east.3 Further, as to the distribution of the Cymry in this early period, it seems here necessary only to. add that the Bretons of Armorica were of this race ; s as also should seem to have been the Belg\u00e6 of Holland, Belgium, Flanders, Picardy, and Normandy, by this time, however, for the most part absorbed by a Teutonic population.1 Thus, as the first important result of our historical criticism, we find that the region in which, as has, in the foregoing chapter been shown, Arthurian localities are now to be found, is co-extensive with that occupied in the sixth century by the Cymric race. On what part of this extensive territory did the events recorded by the earliest historians of the Cymry take place ? The answer given by Mr. Skene, as the result of his examination of the above mentioned sources, and particularly of the Historia Britonum, the earliest of the works collected under the name of Nennius, is \u2014 that these earliest recorded events occurred in the north of this Cymrio territory, in those petty states or kingdoms of Strathclyde and Cumbria, which now form the south of Scotland and the English Border. And the Arthur of Nennius, the only historic Arthur, thus appears as the dux bellorum or Gidedig of these northern Cymric states in a prolonged, but victorious conflict with the Saxons of the Bernician kingdom of the eastern coast, and the Picts from the other side of tho Forth, in the sixth century. For the detailed proof of this very important conclusion, I shall heru only refer to Mr. Skene's recent work ; to those papers in the Gentleman's Magazi-ne of 1842, above referred to (p. xvii0. n. 21), whioh, maintaining a similar theory, first, I believe, suggested to Mr. Skene the course of research, of which we have the ripe fruit in the Four Ancient Boohs ; and to the Appendix to this Essay. \u2022 Four Ancient Books v. I. p. 43. See also Jones (.Archdeacon), Vestiges of thi Gael in Gwynedd. 8 Souvestre, Lis Derniers Bretons, v. I. p. 144. 1 Nichols' Pedigree of the English, p. 40."], [41, "S. (i).] 23 CYMRIC HISTORY. The early distribution of the Cymric race, and the place of the earliest events recorded by its historians, being thus determined, the way is cleared for an answer to the next question that naturally arises in pursuing this investigation, namely, \u2014 to what district, and to what age, does the most ancient Cymric literature, the body of poems attributed to Bards of the sixth century, really belong, and how does Arthur appear in them ? For it is evi dent that, if these poems are genuine, they must reflect the history of that period ; and hence, that their accordance with the ascertained distribution, and facts of the history of the Cymric race in the sixth century, must be taken as the test of the age commonly assigned to them. And \" if we find that they do not re-echo to any extent the fictitious narrative of the events of the fifth and sixth centuries as represented in the Bruts, but rather the leading facts of the early history of the Cymry, as we have been able to deduce them from the older authorities, it will be a strong reason for concluding that they belong themselves to an earlier age.\" 5 Such are the grounds on which Mr. Skene proceeds in controverting the conclusions of that negative school of criticism represented by Mr. Stephens6 and Mr. Nash,1 and which was the natural reaction from the extravagances of the mythologic school of Owen Pughe, and Edward Williams, and, more particu larly, of Davies,8 and of Herbert.9 Mr. Skene thus states the result of his examination of these poems. First, as to the district of the ancient Cymric territory to which they belong : \"Of a large proportion of the historical poems, the scenery and events lie in the north ; the warriors whose deeds they celebrate were ' Gwyr y Gogledd,' or Men of the North ; they are attributed to Bards (Merlin, Taliessin, .Aneurin, 8 Literature of the Kymry. 6 Four Ancient Books, v. I. p. 225. ' Taliessin, or tlie Bards and Druids of Britain. 8 The Mythology of the British Druids. 9 Britannia after tlie Romans, and The Nej-Druidic Heresy."], [42, "24 [Ch. II. ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. and Llywarch Hen,) connected with the north; and are, in point of fact, the literature of the Cymric inhabitants of Cumbria before that kingdom was subjugated by the Saxon king,\"10 Edmund of Wessex, and by him ceded to the Gaelic king, Malcolm, king of Scots, in 946. Secondly, as to the true age of these poems attri buted to Bards of the sixth century, Mr. Skene, while considering that the oldest of them may have their foundation in the national lays of Bards, who lived amid the conflicts of contending races in that century, does not \" place these poems in their earliest con sistent shape further back than the seventh century ;\" when \"the sudden rise of the Cymric population to power under Cadwallawn, and the burst of national enthusiasm and excited hope, found vent in poetry.\" u Lastly, how do these earliest Cymric poems mention Arthur, and where do they place him ? \" Out of so large a body of poems, there are only five which mention him at all, and then it is the historical .Arthur, the Guledig, to whom the defence of the wall was entrusted, and who fights the twelve battles in the north, and finally perishes at Camlan.\" u And Mr. Skene very justly advances this fact in confirmation of the high antiquity which, controverting the conclusions of Mr. Stephens and Mr. Nash, he assigns to these poems. \" H they occupied a place, as is supposed, in Welsh literature, subsequent to the introduction of the Arthurian Eomances, we should expect these poems to be saturated with king Arthur, his knights, and their adventures. But it is not so.\"u The fact is, on the contrary, as above-stated. These results, there fore, of the critical examination of Cymric history, political and literary, lead directly to the positive conclusion that the historical Arthur having been a leader of the northern Cymry, the original birthland of the Arthurian traditions was the region which now forms Southern Sootland, and the English Border. 19 Four Ancient Books, v.

Historical Conditions inimical to the Importation into the North of Arthurian Tradition. But, for the sake of further assurance, let ns suppose that the Arthurian traditions of Scotland did not originate there in an historical Arthur; and so, inquire whether the History of the Northern Cymry presents us with conditions favourable, or inimical, to the importation of such traditions, and their topographical preser vation, if thus derived, and not original. What the general con ditions are that favour, or oppose, the introduction of traditions and traditional topographies from countries in which they have had an actual basis in historical facts, I will not here venture to state. The defining of such conditions belongs, indeed, funda mentally, to a science not yet constituted, a Psychology, not of men considered individually, but collectively. Here it will be sufficient briefly to point-out the chief historical facts connected with the northern Cymry ; and then ask, whether- there are, or not, in these facts, such conditions as our present historical, and\" psychological knowledge would make appear inimical to the derivation from Wales, or elsewhere, of the Arthurian traditional topography of Southern Scotland. Of these facts, the first to be noted is, that the petty Cymric king doms of the north were finally absorbed in the greater kingdom, not only of a kindred Celtic race, but of a race with which the Cymry had never been, except temporarily or occasionally, at war ; and a race, moreover, which had, like the Cymry themselves, been the champions of Christianity against Paganism during the whole of these now dim, but once passion-lit Pre-medi\u00e6val Centuries. The region which, in the tenth century, began to be known as Scotland11 was, in the sixth century, after the withdrawal of the M First so called in that part of the Saxon Chronicle composed about 975s Scotia is used first with its modern meaning by Marianus Scotus in the eleventh century."], [44, "26 [Ch. II. ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. Romans, occupied by the four nations, or rather tribes, of the Cymry, the Scots, the Picts, and the Saxons ; the three first, of Celtic, the last, of Teutonic race. With the Picts on the north, and the Saxons on the east, the Cymry were in constant warfare ; and had either the Saxons or the Picts finally succeeded in con solidating these various tribes in a new nationality, there would be evident psychological grounds for the hypothesis that the Arthurian traditions of Scotland were not the legendary records of historical events which had there occurred, but of events which had elsewhere happened, and of which the traditions had been imported to console a conquered race under a foreign and hated yoke. But neither by the Picts, nor by the Angles, with whom they had been for centuries at war, were the Cymry of the north finally absorbed ; but by the Scots, a brother of whose king they had themselves voluntarily elected to the throne in 918, previously to their being regularly incorporated into the Scotish nationality after the Treaty of 946, between Malcolm H. and then Saxon foe, Edmund of Wessex. But in these Pre-medi\u00e6val Centuries, ecclesiastical is even more important than political history. The history of Christianity is then, indeed, what the history of Philosophy and of Science has become since the upbreak of the Catholico-feudal system of the MediiBval Age ; that which alone, making transparent the spirit animating the outward forms of political changes, reveals to us their deepest causes. For not only had Churchmen, in these ancient centuries, a predominant influence in accomplishing, or retarding, political revolutions ; but with a native Church was indissolubly connected the national language and literature. How, then, do the chief facts of the ecclesiastical history of the northern Cymric States bear on the question before us? Now we find that the Christianity of Scotland was derived from two differont sources. Directly from Rome came the Missions to the Cymry and Angles"], [45, "6. (n).] CYMRIC HISTORY. 27 of the south; while those to the Scots and Picts of the north, emanated from the Irish Church of St. Patrick. This latter Church was distinctively monastic in its organization ; and hence arose an opposition between the two Christian Churches of North Britain, which could not, in that Pro-medi\u00e6val Age, but have the most important political, and other effects. For us, it is sufficient here to note that it was the Irish, or Columban Church of the Scots that ultimately acquired the supremacy ; a supremacy marked by the foundation, in the year 736, of the Church of S.

Peter, as the patron saint of the kingdom.15 And hence we see that, in the victory of the opponent Church with its G\u00e6lic language and litera ture, the way was already, in the eighth century, prepared, not only for that political incorporation of the northern Cymric States in the kingdom of the Scots which took place in the tenth century, but for that complete absorption of the Cymric by the G\u00e6lic race, indicated by such a speedy disappearance of the language of the former that, at the opening of the Medi\u00e6val Age, in the eleventh century, we find the various tribes of North Britain consolidated into a G\u00e6lic-speaking kingdom.16 u Compare Skene, Chronicles of the Fids and Scots, pp. clxx.-iv., Innes, Sketches of Early Scotish History, ch. i. etc., and Burton, History of Scotland, v.

If two distinct dialects of an origin so different had existed beyond the forth in the days of Huntingdon, how could he have written about the extinction of the Pictish people and their language, when the dialect which was not Scotish would have assuredly been regarded as Pictish ?

[Ch. II. Still other facts there are, however, which seem to make in credible any other derivation of Scotish Arthurian topography than from an historical leader of the northern Cymry. For the con quering Scots were no illiterate horde of barbarians. On the con trary, \" Anglo-saxon literature had not begun to spread when that of the Scots was supreme. . . . And by the Scots writers, whether of Dalriada or Ireland, the Saxons are spoken of without any affectation as barbarians, just as they would have been spoken of by the Romans. From the other side even, in Bede's own patriotic narrative, the sense of inferiority is distinctly apparent. Indeed he traces one of the greatest contributions towards their civdization which the Saxons received, directly to Iona.\"\" And, what still more directly bears on the present question, the Scots had a tradi tional and poetic literature of their own, which must certainly have greatly opposed the introduction, after their incorporation of the Cymry, of Cymric poetry and tradition, and must, also, have been a condition highly unfavourable to the preservation of such tradition, Saxons But (did this Teutonic speaking colony arrive at a later period after the union of the Picts and Scots under the line of Kintyre ? If so, it must have been of Scandinavian origin. But history, which has preserved the remembrance of the Scandinavian settlements on the northern mainland, and throughout the western islands, is totally silent about any such colonization in the southern and eastern low lands of ancient Alban. Where history is silent, topography sometimes reveals the secrets of the past But the map may be searched in vain for any such traces in the northern lowlands of a band of colonists so numerous and so important, as to retain this dialect, which they never stamped upon the face of the country, and to perpetuate it as one of the original sources of the Lowland Scotch spoken at the present day. The existence of such a population in such a quarter is as apocryphal as the mythical Scotish conquest. . . . The English wars stamped a nationality upon tho descendants of the various races subject to the Rex Scotorum, and as the use of (Gaelic, and) Norman-French died away, and the ' quaint Inglis' of Southern Scotland and the civic population became the language of the king and his nobility, spreading gradually over the whole of those lowland districts which had long formed tho heart of ancient Alban, the Gaelic tongue, rather than the Gaelic race, was at length confined to tbe mountains, and the names of Scot and Scotland were adopted as national and generic terms from thc language which had now become the national speech.

But, to the third Chapter, in which I shall have to treat of the relation of the Fingalian to the Arthurian topography of Scotland, I shall defer any further notice of the Ossianic poetry of the Scots. Suppose, then, that T Gogledd, The North, or what we now call southern Scotland, was not the historical birthland of the Arthurian traditions, how came they there? Are there not, in the above stated facts, conditions in the highest degree inimical to the introduction of these traditions from without ? Topographically rooted, popular traditions are phenomena that must have no slight causes. What causes do we find in the history of the North that are sufficient to explain its Arthurian topography, otherwise than as originating in the life and the wars of a native and historical Arthur ? Mr. Pearson, indeed, maintains that the historical Arthur was sovereign of a territory in the southwest of England, of which Camelot or Cadbury, in Somersetshire was the capital ; and, admitting how numerous are the Arthurian localities of Scotland, asks, \" now assuming Arthur's history to become first extensively popular in the twelfth century, who are most likely to take it up, and identify it with localities in their own neighbourhood ? The Saxons or Saxonized settlers in Devonia, or the Welsh and Picts of Galloway ? Surely the latter. Which history can best be interpolated with strange facts ? the history of the conquered and civilized western counties, or that of districts which long maintained their barbarous independence? Again, the latter.\" u But to this it appears sufficient to reply that the Cymry of the North were not only not in a state of \" barbarous \"independence\" in the twelfth century ; but that, as above shown, they were unresistingly incorporated in the monarchy of the Scots in the tenth century ; and that a Church and language opposed to their own had become supreme in Scotland in the eighth 18 Bishop Percy's Folio MS., v.

ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. century.19 If, therefore, Arthurian traditions are admitted to be thus numerous in Scotland, how can we account for their origin there on any reasonable hypothesis of importation ? In the fact, then, of the Pre-medi\u00e6val absorption of the northern Cymry by a kindred race, with whom they had never been at war ; in the fact of the loss of their native language succeeding the subjection of their native church ; and in the fact of the conquering Scots having a traditional and poetic literature of their own ; there were conditions that seem to make it impossible to explain the existence of Arthurian localities in Scotland on any other theory than that to which we have been led by the critical examination of the earliest historical sources, and earliest bardic poems of the Cymry; namely, that these localities were, in the North, not the creations of a fond fancy acting on a transplanted tradition, but the genuine records of a native, historical hero. sect/on (in). Historical Conditions favourable to the Importation into the South of Arthurian Tradition. Very different was the history of the Cymric kingdoms of what afterwards became the West of England, and the North-west of France. These, after a resistance, enduring with various fortune, for many centuries, were ultimately overpowered by a foreign, and chiefly Teutonic, race ; against whom it was, and is, their pride to maintain their native language ; and to preserve, or invent, glori fying traditions. Not hore, as in the North, were the Cymry ab sorbed by a kindred race. Further, not only were there migrations from Strathclyde and Cumbria, which would carry the Arthurian traditions, suppose them to have had their historical origin in the North, into new southern homes, but it was from the northern region of Manau, or Manann 19 See also in answer to Mr. Pearson's objections to the theory maintained by Mr. Skene and myself, infra, p. 131."], [49, "S.

And when this house failed in the person of Cynan Tyndathwy, there is every reason to believe that the same region gave a second royal house to Wales, in the person of Mervyn Frych ;\"J0 and so, also, it should seem that one dynasty, at least, of tho kings of Cornwall was descended from a northern family. And that there were large and frequent migrations from Cornwall to Brittany is well known. And coiasider these critical results. \" If the poems attributed to the bards of the sixth century really belong to that period,\" \u2014 (we have seen that, in Mr. Skene's opinion, they cannot be carried further back in their earliest consistent shape, than the seventh century) \u2014 \"there is an interval of several centuries during which such a literature either never existed, or has perished, till the twelfth century, from which period a mass of poetic literature existed in Wales, and has been preserved to us. Of the genuine character of that poetry there seems to be no doubt.\"21 As to the Cymric literature of Brittany, the Poemes des Bards Bretons au Sixieme Siecle, of M. de la Villemarque, can only for a moment mislead by its title. It is, in fact, but a French edition of those ancient Cymric poems which, as we have seen, belong, in Mr. Skene's opinion, to the northern kingdoms of Cumbria and Strathclyde, absorbed by the Scotish nationality. And considering how much the brilliant volumes of M. de la Villemarque have done in elucidating and popu larizing the whole cycle of Arthurian romance, it is with regret that one finds grave suspicion cast on his perfect honesty as a collector of Breton ballads; and objections, hitherto, I believe, unanswered raised against the genuineness of what have been given to the world as ancient Cymric poems of Brittany. But this being so, we are left with the Four Ancient Books of Wales, or rather, if Mr. Skene's criticism of them is accepted, of Arthurian Scotland, as presenting to !0 Four Ancient Books, v. I. pp. 93-4. 21 Ibid. p. 19."], [50, "32 [Ch. II. ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. us the only genuine fragments of Cymric literature of the Pre medi\u00e6val Age. Remark also the fact that it was with the loss of national indepen dence that all the genuine Cymric literature, later than these Four Books, arose. With the defeat and death of Rhys ap Tewdwr, fight ing against the Normans under Robert Fitzhamon, the kingdom of South Wales came to an end in 1090. And though native princes stUl ruled in North Wales till 1282, the death in that year of Llywelyn was followed by the subjugation of all Wales by King Edward the First. It was cotemporaneously with these events that Welsh literature arose, and that the MSS. were written which we now possess of the ancient poems of the northern Cymry, by this time completely absorbed in the new nationality to which the con quering Celtic race of the Scots had given their name. In a literature composed under such circumstances, it is evident that the localization of Arthur in Wales\" can be of no independent force; nor can it, indeed, be regarded as anything more than such a localizing and magnifying of northern Cymric uaditions, as was calculated to soothe a conquered race in their dejection, and to flatter them with new hope. And, finally, observe that, throughout the whole of this southern region, tha ground was most eminently prepared for the reception of Arthurian traditions. For, in the first place, there must, by the eleventh or twelfth centuries, have been many traditions of conquest, as of defeat, during the half-mQlenium of wars with the Saxons. There may, also, during these five hundred years, very probably have been southern leaders of the same name as the great northern Guledig of the sixth century ; or leaders, such as Dr. Guest's Owen Finddu (?) (above p. 11, n. 21) whose story m Nor even, when Arthur is placed by this later literature in Wales, docs this necessarily mean tho present Principality ; for by writers of this age\u2014 Froissurt for instance \u2014 tho mountains of Cumberland wero still called Wales."], [51, "S. (m).j CYMRIC HISTORi'. 33 could readily get confounded with that of Arthur. And, further, though the traditions of Arthur, Guenivere, and Lanoelot, .of Merlin the Bard, of Perceval, Gawayne, and Mordred, would appear to have had their historical origin among the Northern Cymry of what is now Southern Scotland; yet these, though the main, are not the only traditions on which the Arthurian Romance-cycle is founded; and Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany very possibly had the way prepared for the introduction from the North of the main Arthurian tradition, by the existence in each of them already of traditions with which the northern story might be readdy connected. As to what, how ever, really were the native Arthurian traditions of Wales, Corn wall, and Brittany respectively, I will not here venture to say more than that the tradition of Mark should seem to be the special con tribution of Cornwall to the cycle of Arthurian romance. How similar the story of Mark is to the domestic tradition of Arthur need hardly be noted ; except more clearly to show how readily explicable, on the theory here maintained, is the association in Cornish localities of the traditions of Mark and of Arthur. Considering these facts \u2014 the conquest by a foreign race, but pre servation of the language, of the Cymric kingdoms of the South ; the Cymric migrations from, but not to, the North, and the northern descents of some of the southern dynasties ; the Medi\u00e6val, and not Pre-medi\u00e6val, age of the whole of Cymric literature, except those earlier poems in which Arthur is but some half-dozen times men tioned, and then, as it should seem, as a leader of the Northern Cymry; the upburst of this Medi\u00e6val Cymric literature cotempo raneously with the last struggles for, and final loss of, national in dependence ; and the general preparation of the southern kingdoms for the transplanting of Arthurian localities ; \u2014 can we refuse to see conditions in the highest degree favourable to the importation from the North of the Arthurian traditions of the West of England and the North-west of France? 3"], [52, "34 [Ch. II. ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. Such, then, are the theoretical considerations, arising from the latest results of the criticism of Cymric history and literature ; considerations that lead us both directly, and indirectly, to the conclusion that Southern Scotland and the English Border was the historical birthland of the main Arthurian traditions. For, not only does the direct criticism of the eaarliest historical records, and earliest bardic poems, lead to the conclusion that Arthur was an actual sixth-century leader of the northern Cymry ; but the further investigation of Cymric history presents to us conditions highly unfavourable in the North, and highly favourable in the South, to an hypothesis of the outward derivation of the Arthurian traditions of which, both in the North and in the South, we find topographical records. But, as I have above admitted, the ma- terials for forming an assured critical conclusion on such a question as the present are too scanty, to make our theory independent of verification from some other line of research. How is this to be attempted ? By a thorough investigation of the Arthurian topo- graphy of the North. For if we should find that Arthurian loca- lities are here more numerous than in any of the other regions of the Old Arthurland ; that these localities are not spread over Scot- land, but are confined to the region which in the sixth, but not after tho tenth century, was mainly peopled by a Welsh-speaking race ; that they are thickest just where tho battles between the Cymry and their Saxon and Pictish foes must have been most frequent; that the exceptions to the rule of Arthurian localities being found only where thero was anciently a Cymric population, do but make the accordance between tradition and historical fact all the more strik- ing ; and that, finally, with localities in the North, not Arthur only, but all the chief characters of Arthurian Romanoe, are connected ; I think it will have to be conceded that we have a very complete inductive verification of our theoretical conclusions from the oriti ciaru of Cy mrio History."], [53, "Ch. III.] 35 ARTHURIAN SCOTLAND. CHAPTER ni. THE CHIEF COUNTRY OP ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES, AS GENERALIZED FROM AN EXPLORATION OF SOUTHERN SCOTLAND AND THE ENGLISH BORDER. Let me now proceed to give the generalized result of my exploration of the existing Arthurian Topography of the region indicated by the criticism of Cymric history as the birthland of Arthurian tradition, in a narrative of a single hypothetical journey in which a very great number of actual journeys through particular districts are connected, as in the route on the accom panying map. Let us suppose ourselves, then, to start from the Braes of Mar, at the foot of Ben-Muich-Dhui,1 the central dome of that mountain range of the Grampians, which, as we shall find in the next chapter, separates Arthurian, from Fingalian Scot land. For, journeying, and it must be /on foot, up Glen Cluny, and Glen Callater ; \u2014 ascending the wild, and solitary heights at the head of Loch Callater to the plateau of the Einlochan Forest ; \u2014 passing along the eastern edge of the deep glen which runs up through this plateau, with hawks and eagles over head, and great herds of red deer in the woody pastures of the glen below ; \u2014 and travelling through Upper and Lower Glen Isla ; we shall, in a single day's journey, \u2014 but of some thirty or forty miles,\u2014 pass through scenery which will remain in our recollection as a grand background to that of Arthurian Scotland ; and, coining down on the most north-eastern group of Arthurian localities, our route will be southwards, through the eastern part of the Arthurian region, and then up again, north wards, on its western side. We shall thus explore successively three great divisions of Arthu- 1 For a more detailed account of this grand central district of Scotland than is found in the ordinary Guide-Books, see Bttbton's Cairngorm Mountains, and Taylor's Braemar Highlands ; the former, for mountain climbing ; and the latter, for traditional tales."], [54, "36 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. [Ch. III. rian localities \u2014 an Eastern, a Southern, or Border, and a Western Division ; and the very numerous localities of each of these divi sions we shall find to lie in three naturally distinguished districts, giving us, thus, in \" the North,\" no less than nine distinct Districts of Arthurian Localities. And, further, we shall find these localities to be of three different classes, which may be distinguished as Tradi tional, Historical, and Poetical ; the first, being localities which, in their names and the still hving traditions attached to them, are Arthurian ; the seeond, being identifications of places connected with the Arthurian story as it is found in the earliest historical sources ; and the third, being identifications of places mentioned in those Four Ancient Books of Cymric Poetry which we have found to belong, in their subject-matter, to the Arthurian Age, meaning by that term, not merely the generation of Arthur, but the century which opens with his exploits. That, side by side with these identifications of historical and poetical sites, we should find a very great number of traditional localities, is evidently, in itself, and apart from other considerations, no slight proof of the correctness of these identifi cations. SECTION (i). The Eastern Division of Arthurian Scotland. Lower Glen Isla hes between the main line of the Grampians and the lower range of hills, through the eastern end of whioh the road passes. Here we find ourselves with a wooded hill on the right, and, on the left, a steep, furze-covered hill, the last of the range in this direction, and with the remains of what has apparently been a formidable stronghold on its summit. It is Barry-hill (Barra, fortified hill), and the first Arthurian locality of what I would dis tinguish as District I. \u2014 Strathmore.

For innumerable legends agree in representing it as the Castle to which the Pictish king Mordred, having defeated King Arthur in a great battle, carried off as a prisoner his queen Quenivere, or, as she is locally named, Ganora, Vanora, or Wander.2 This, however, it seems, she found by no means so unpleasant as she ought to have done. For \" Vanora,\" says tradition, \"held an unlawful intercourse with Mordred; and Arthur, when he received her again,\" did not act with the magna nimity of Mr. Tennyson's flos regum, but, \" enraged at her infidelity, caused her to be torn to pieces by wild horses.\" 3 As an old fellow, however, with whom I got into talk on the road near this, and who told me a legend I had not previously heard of the four places in this neighbourhood where the parts of Queen Vanora's dismembered body were buried, sagely remarked : \" Thae auld histories are maistly lees, I'm thinkin'.\" Her tomb (or principaal tomb), \" Ganore's Grave,\" hes but a few miles off. For \" she was buried at Meigle, and a monument erected to perpetuate her infamy.\" Gray, who visited the place from Glammis Castle, notes : \" Passed through Meigill, where is the tomb of Queen Wander, that was riven to death by stoned horses for nae gude that she did, \u2014 so the woman here told me, I assure yon.\" * And on examining the curious sculptured stones in Meigle churchyard,5 said to be the remains of this monument, we do actually find \" two representations of wild beasts tearing a human body, \u2014 and one where the body seems tied, or close to chariot 2 Called \"Wanore and Vanore in the Scotish Romanes of Lancelot of the Laik of 1478 or 1490.

It was the close of autumn. Along the broad valley of Strathmore, ending northwards in the Howe of the Mearns, and sheltered from the sea by the Sidlaw Hills, with their many legends of Duncan, Macbeth,9 and Banquo, the farm-yards were closely stacked with the ingathered corn ; the leaves, whirled by gentle breezes, were falling through the sunny air ; and beneath the lofty range of the snow-capped Grampians, lay the dying year in the beauty of an ineffable repose. Mordred thus appears, in Scotish tradition, as both the political hostis, or foe, and the domestic inimicus, or unfriend, of Arthur ; but in Medi\u00e6val Romance he commonly occupies the former position only, while his traditional part, as the lover of Guenivere, is taken by Lancelot. The question then arises, can Lancelot, as well as Mordred, be localized in Scotland ? Now M. de la Villemarque very ingeniously identifies Lancelot, or L'Ancelot, with the Cymric chieftain Ma el : \" Les plus anciens manuscrits .... portent souvent Ancelot .... Ancel, en langue rornane, signifie servant, et Ancelot est son diminutif .... Si, par hasard, Ancelot etait la traduction du nom d'un personnage gallois, dont l'histoire s'accorderait en tout point avec le roman ?

For \"le chef Mael, selon les bardes gallois, avait dans l'Ecosse des domaines ou il la mena.\"10 But we may far more directly identify the country of Lancelot with a Scotish district, for he is uniformly spoken of iu the Romances as the son of \"le roy Ban de Benoic ; \" and in the Scotish Lancelot of 1478, this \" Benoic\" is at once identified for us in the lines \u2014 \" a knycht clepit Lancelot of ye Laik, That sone of Bane was king of Albanak \" \u2014 u Albanak, or Alban, being the well-known name applied to Scot land beyond the Firths of Forth and Clyde.18 And that it was in the eastern part of that region that the kingdom of Lancelot's father was situated, we may presume from the fact of its ,having been \" le roy Claudas de la terre d'Escosse \" (the western kingdom of the Scots of Dalriada ?) who \" mena guerre contre le roy Ban de Benoic et le roy Boort de Ganues (or Gannes) tant quil les desherita de leurs terres.\"13 Thus, the Mael of tradition, and the Lancelot of romance, and the Mordred both of tradition and romance, are as closely connected in the scenes, as in the stories of their lives. In very remarkable proximity to the Castle of Mordred, and the Grave of Guenivere, we find near Meigle, and in the parish of Cupar Angus, a standing stone called the Stone of Arthur ; near it, again, 8 Les Romans de la Table Bonds, pp. 58-9. 10 Ibid. p. 64, citing The Myryrian Arch\u00e6ology, v.I. p. 175. 11 lines 201-2, p. 7, of the Edition of the E.

There is no known river bearing a name approaching to this. Tratheu, or shores, implies a sea-shore or sandy beach, and can only be applicable to a river having an estuary. An old description of Scotland, written in 1165 by one familiar with Welsh names, says that the river which divides the ' regna Anglorum et Scottorum et currit juxta oppidum de Strivelin ' was ' Scottice vocata Froch, Britannice Werid.'m This Welsh name for the Forth at Stirling has disappeared, but it closely resembles the last part of Nonnius' name, and the difference between wruid, the last part of Nennius' name Try-wruid, and Werid is trifling.

These Mr. Skene would make the site of Arthur's sixth battle \" super flumen quod vocatur Bassas.\" 30 There is now no river of this name in Scotland ; but, as Mr. Skene remarks, \" the name Basss is also applied to a peculiar mound having the appear ance of being artificial, which is formed near a river, though really formed by natural causes. There is one on the Ury river in Aberdeenshire, termed the Bass of Inverury, and there are two on the bank of the Carron, now called Dunipace, erroneously sup posed to be formed from the Gaelic and Latin words Duni pads, or hills of peace, but the old form of which was Dunipais, the latter syllable being no doubt the same word Bass. Directly opposite, the river Bonny flows into the Carron, and on this river I am disposed to place the sixth battle.\" 31 But I venture to think that a personal inspection of the ground would not only have convinced Mr. Skene that the Park of Duni pace was a very unlikely place for a great battle, but have shown him, on the opposite side of the Carron, almost directly opposite these mounds, and in the angle formed by the junction of the Bonny with the Carron, another, and vastly larger Bass ; a moraine (?) with three of its sides (those towards the Bonny and Carron) as steep and sharply defined at the edges as walls, and forming a natural stronghold, the broad flat summit of which, waving \u2014 28 Charta Newbotle, No. 239, cited by Chalmers, Caledonia, v.

This natural fortress must certainly have been the scene of many a conflict between Cymiy, Picts and Saxons in the Arthu rian Age ; and all Mr. Skene's arguments would, as it appears to me, apply with ten-fold more force to this Bass than to those he has fixed on, as the site of the sixth battle of the Arthur of Nennius. From an old man, with whom I had some talk on the Bridge of Carron, I found that, in spaets, the river not unfrequently over flowed to the very base of this hill, and that it, and the farm to which it belongs, is called Roughmute. And many a rough moot, or counoil, has no doubt been held there. After the old man left me, I suddenly remembered, as I looked over the bridge, and up the river, that the Carron was one of Ossian's favourite streams. \" I behold not the form of my son at Carun ; nor the figure of Oscar in Crona. The rustling winds have carried him far away, and the heart of his father is sad. \" s> And so, instead of proceeding on my way, I wandered up its southern banks for a mile or two, coming down to the bridge again on the other side.

Medraut or Modred was the son of that Llew to whom Arthur is said to have given Lothian, and who, as Lothus, king of the Picts, is invariably connected with this part of Scotland. His forces were Saxons, Picts, and Scots, the very races Arthur is said to have conquered in his Scotish cam paigns. Xf it is to be viewed as a real battle at all, it assumes the appearance of an insurrection of the conquered districts, under Medraut, the son of that Llew to whom one of them was given.\"33 Remark, further, not only that the site bears still the very same name as the battle ; but that it is, as we have already in part seen, in the centre of a group of Arthurian localities ; and further that, as history has shown, it is well fitted to be a great battle-field. For, in later historical times, two great battles have been fought at, or near Camelon ; that of Falkirk, but a mile distant, in 1298, between the Scots and the English; and that of Falkirk -muir, in 1746, between the Hanoverian forces, under General Hawley, and the Highlanders, commanded by Prince Charles Stuart. But twenty-one years before this final Arthurian battle of the year 537, namely, in 516. was fought that twelfth battle \"in Monte Badonis,\" of Nennius, the \"obsessio Montis Badonici,\" of Gildas, the site of which has given rise to so much discussion. \"It has been supposed to have been near Bath, but the resemblance of names seems alone to have led to this tradition.

The scene of the battle near Bath was said to be on the Avon, which Layamon35 mentions as flowing past Badon Hill. But on the Avon, not far from Linlithgow, is a very remark able hdl, of considerable size, the top of which is strongly fortified with double ramparts, and past which the Avon flows. This hill is called Bouden Hill. Sibbald says, in his Account of Linlithgowshire, in 1710, ' On the Buden Hill are to be seen the vestiges of an outer and inner camp. There is a great cairn of stones upon Lochcote Hills, over against Buden, and in the adjacent ground there have been found chests of stones, with bones in them, but it is uncertain when or with whom the fight was.' As this battle was the last of twelve which seem to have formed one series of campaigns, I venture,\" says Mr. Skene, \" to identify Bouden HOI with the Mons Badonicus.\" x After enjoying the beautiful view from the top, with the Little Bouden and Cockleroy Hills on my right, as I looked north over the undulating country about Linlithgow, with its ancient royal palace on the lake, across to the fine estuary of the Forth, the shores of Fife and Clackmannan, and the Ochil Hdls (Sliabnochel, or Ocelli Montes) ; I found, in talk with an old man of upwards of fourscore (\"81 on the 21st of last July\"), who was breaking stones on the roadside, what appeared to me an interesting confirmation of Mr. Skene's hypothesis, in a tradition of Arthur's presence here, at least, 34 May there not bo a reminiscence of this name in the Gallehault of the French, and thc Galyot of thc Scotish, Romance of Lancelot ! 38 \" There sank to the bottom five and twenty hundred, so that all Ayon's stream was bridged with steel.\" \u2014 Brut.

Very probably, had I asked the old man whether he did not mean that it was Arthur, and not the Bomans, who \"lifted\" the camp, he would have assented. But one cannot get truth if one does not guard against the temptation to put such leading questions in support of one's theories. 38 I found that such phrases as \"auld histories,\" and \" mentioned in history,\" did not mean, with these old men, written, but traditional history. 39 Historical Maps \u2014 Britannia Cambria. \"> Four Ancient Books, y.

That the Edin in (the former of ?) these two names is the Eyddin of the poem is clear from a poem in the Black Book of Caermarthen, where Edinburgh is called Mynyd Eiddin ; \" and in a poem in the Book of Taliessin there is the expresion \"Rhuing Dineiddyn ac Dineiddwg,\" where Dineiddyn can hardly be anything but Dunedin. At Caredin the Roman wall terminated And Caredin is not far from the river Avon, and parallel to it flows the river Carron, the two rivers enclosing a district at the west end of which is a great moor still called Slamannan ; in old Gaelic \"Sliabh Manand,\" the moor or plain of Manand. This is the \" Campus Manand \" of Tighernac, and the A von and Carron are meant by the Haefe and Caere of the Saxon Chronicle, and the Heue and Cere of Henry of Huntingdon. Now Gododin contained this district. For the Guotodin of the \"Manau Guotodin,\" mentioned by Nennius as \"regio in sinistrali parte insul\u00e6\" (an expression equivalent in Welsh to 'y gogledd,' or the North), is plainly the samo as the Gododin of Aneurin ; and the Cymrio Manau of Gododin is, in its Gaelic form, Manand. Gododin was, 81 Four Ancient Books, y. II. p. 359."], [67, "49 S. (,).] ARTHURIAN SCOTLAND. therefore, equivalent to the north part of Lothian, and was washed by the Firth of Forth.42 So much for the identification of Eyddin and Gododin. Now as to Catraeth. \"The Irish Annals frequently mention a district called Calathros ; as in Tighernac in 736, ' Bollum Cnuice Cairpre i Calathros uc etar linn du,' which latter place can be identified as Carriber on the Avon, near Linlithgow. Calathros, therefore, adjoined this district. Its Latin form was Calatria .... Now, in the address of Walter L' Espee at the battle of the Standard in 1130, as reported by Ailred Calatria is placed between Lothian and Scotland proper, north of the Firths. And Calatria is surely the Cymric Galtraeth,43 which we know was the same place as Catraeth.44 All the re quirements of the site seem, therefore, satisfied in that part of Scotland where Lothian meets Stirlingshire, in the two districts of Gododin and Catraeth, both washed by the sea of the Firth of Forth ; and where the great Roman Wall terminates at Caredin, or the fort of Eidin.\" *\u2022 \"As to the date of the battle we are not without indications The combatants were, on the one side, the Britons and tho Scots under Aidan ; the enemy or ' Barbari ' were the Pagan Saxons and the half-Pagan Picts of Manau Guotodin, called in the poem the ' bedin ' or host of Gododin. And the identity of the battle of Catraeth with the ' bellum Miathorum ' of Adomnan enables us to fix its date at 596. But the first part alone of the poem of the Gododin relates to this battle ; the second part, or continuation, contains in it an allusion to the death \" This is also the opinion of Mr. Beale Poste ; but Mr. Nash and Archdeacon Jones place Manau Guotodin in the district about Jedbugh, and extend it into Northumberland. 43 For a further account of Calatria see Chronicles of the Picis and Scots.

The upper part of the vale of the Carron, through which the river, after rising in the Fintry Hills, flows, is called Strathcarron ; but it also bore the name of Strathcawin And in the Statistical Account of the parish of Fintry there is the following notice: 'At the foot of the rock which encircles the western brow of the Fintry Hills there is a considerable extent of table-land, and on the descent below this starts out a knoll, commonly known by the name of ihe Dun or Down, of a singular appearance.

I found that there had been recently discovered, ne<ir Caredin, a stone with an inscription in admirable preservation, of the Second Augustan Legion, on completing a certain distance of the wall under Anto.iinus Pius.

Finally, on our way into the next Arthurian district we shall pass on the borders of the counties of Edinburgh and Peebles, the Moss of Maw mentioned in the Book of Taliessin as the Bush of Maw.72 We enter now on the exploration of District III. \u2014 Tweeddale. \u2014 At Peebles on the Tweed, or Tywi of the Four Ancient Books,13 we find one of the many wells, or fountains, dedi cated to S.

From his account there seemed to be some doubt as to which of two localities here had the best traditional right to be called the Grave of Merlin. That now certainly the most picturesque, and maintained by the late Dr. Somerville, the minister of the parish, to be the true site of the tomb, is by an ancient thorn-tree, of which there is now a younger thriving off shoot (fair augury of a renewal of Merlin's fame), by the burnside, a little above its junction with the Tweed, and at the foot of the moraine, on which stands the kirk and manse. But it seems that, at the corner of what is now a corn-field, there used to be a caini( called Merlin's Grave ; and though the Pausayl does not at present meet the Tweed at this spot, yet it did so for a time, in consequence of a groat spaet or overflow of the river, when the Scotish James VT. became king of England, and so the prophecy was fulfilled that \" When Tweed and Pausayl meet at Merlin's grave, Scotland and England one king shall have.\" 7S For me, not only the weight of authority, but the perennial 74 Scotichronicon, B.

For this is always introduced in the romantic fictions that represent his ladye-love, Viviana,79 as imprisoning Merlin, not, in the earlier romances, at least, that she might basely triumph over him, but that he might be with her for evermore. And though, in its present disafforested state. the scenery of the here narrow valley of the Tweed, and its enclosing hills is somewhat disappointing ; it cannot be looked on with indifference by any one who knows how, \"la plus ancienne tradition romanesque a fait agir Merhn, comment eUe a personnifie et idealise' en lui le devouement passiorme a. tout ce que la grande epoque chevaleresque jugeait digne de son respect ; je veux dire la rehgion, la patrie, la royaute, l'amour, l'amour pur, discret, delicat, la sohtude a deux eternellement enchantee.\"80 And well may the French savant m his history of the bard, his works, and influence, refuse to follow him, \u2014 \" a travers les fantaisies des continuateurs et 78 \" It also seems evident,\" says the Eev. T. Price, \" that it is to the Hwimleian, or Chwifleian of Merlinus Silvcstris,\" the historical Merlin of Scotland, \"that we are to attribute the origin of the Viviane of the romances of Chivalry, and who acts so conspicuous a part in those compositions, although it is true there is not much resemblance betwixt the two names. But if we look into the poems of Merlin Sylvestris, we shall find that the female personage of this name, which by the French romances might easily be modified into Viviane, is repeatedly referred to by the bard in his vaticinations. It also seems probable, as Chwifleian signifies a female who appears and disappears, and also as the word bears some resemblance in sound to Sybilla, that the bard, by a confusion of terms and ideas, not uncommon in early writers, coined this name as an appellation for some imaginary character, and thus furnished the original of Viviane.\" Literary Remains, v. I. p. 144. This Merlin also had a twin-siBter Gwtndydd or Ganieda, who supplied her brother with food, in his solitary wanderings in the Caledonian Forest. In a poem in the Bed Book of Hergest (Four Ancient Books, v. I. p. 462) she addresses him as Llallogan or twin-brother. \"And this,\" says Mr. Price, \"will explain a passage in the Life of S. Kentigern, in which it is said that there was at the court of Bydderch Hael, a certain idiot named Laloicen, who uttered predictions: \u2014 'In curia ejus quidam homo fatuus vocabulo Laloicen;' and in the Scotichronicon it is stated that this Laloicen was Myrddin Wyllt.

It was in the forest of Northumberland that dwelt the Hermit Blaise to whom Merlin is represented as so often repairing, in order that being \" a nobdl clerk and subtle,\" he might put in writing all the wonderful things that befed in those days. And one chapter, for instance, of the French Eomance of Lancelot is headed, \" Comment la Dame de Noehault envoya deuers le Eoy Artus, luy supplier qud luy envoya secours contre le Eoy de Norhombellaande qui luy menoit guerre.\" Northumberland also formed part of the Berneich of Nennius, the Tir Brenech of Llywarch Hen, and the Brenneich of Aneurin, the Anglic kingdom of Bernicia.

For six or eight mdes to the north of these stations, and in the neighbourhood of Housesteads, the most complete of the stations on the Eoman Wall, are the principal Arthurian Localities of this Northumbrian District. The scenery here is very remarkable. The green, but unwooded grazing hdls, \u2014 wide and wild-looking from their want of enclosures, and the infrequency of farm-houses, \u2014 seem like the vast billows of a north-sweeping tide. Along one of these wave-lines runs the Eoman Wall, with the stations of its garrison. In the trough, as it were, of this mighty sea, and to the north of the WaU, were, till a few years ago removed and ploughed over, the ruins of the ancient castle of Sewing Shields, referred to by Sir Walter Scott as the Castle of the Seven Shields,108 and by Camden as Seavenshale.100 Beneath it, as under the Eildons, Arthur and all his court are said to lie in an enchanted sleep.

The northern faces of tliree successive billows here, if I may so call them, present fine precipitous crags, \u2014 whinstone and sand stone strata cropping out. These are called respectively Sewing Shields Crags, the King's, and the Queen's Crags. Along the crest of the first of these the Eoman Wall is carried. The others take their name from having been the scene of a httle domestic quarrel, or tiff, between King Arthur and Queen Quenivere. To settle the matter, the king sitting on a rock called Arthur's Chair, threw at the queen an immense boulder which, falling somewhat short of its aim, is still to be seen on this side of the Queen's Crags. And on the horizon of the immense sheep farm of Sewing Shields, and beyond an outlying shepherd's hut, very appropriately named Coldknuckles, is a great stone called Cumming's Cross, to which there is attached another rude Arthurian tradition. For here, they say, that King Arthur's sons attacked, and murdered a northern chieftain who had been visiting their father at Sewing Shields Castle, and who was going home with too substantial proofs, as they thought, of the king's generosity. Thence, over a most bracingly wdd, wide-horizoned, and open Border-country to Liddesdale.111 At the head of this famous dale we find Dawston, which may be reckoned among localities of tlie Arthurian Age, as the scene of that great battle of Dagsestan of 603, in which Aidan, who seems to have been, like Arthur some sixty years before, performing the functions of Guledig or \"Dux 110 Hodgson, History of Northumberland, Part II. v.

One day that the saint was praying in a wild solitude of the Caledonian Forest, there sprang across his path \" quidam demons, nudus et hir sutus, ab omni solatio mundiali destitutus, quasi quoddam torvum furiale.\" The saint asked this strange being who, or what he was, and received for answer, \" Ohm Quortigerni vates, Merlinus voci tatus, in hae solitudine dura patiens Eram enim c\u00e6dis omnium causa intereinptonim qui interfecti sunt in bello, cunctis in hae patria constitutis satis noto, quod erat in campo inter Lidel et Carvanolow situato.\"11' Carwhinelow is a burn, on which there is a village of the same name, and which flows from Nicholl Forest into the Esk. And some httle way above the junction of the Esk, with the Liddel is what is caUed in the Statistical Account, the Moat of Liddel, though known in the country only as the Eoman Camp. It is situated on the top of a high bank overhanging the river, to which, on the north side, the rock goes sheer down ; while on the other side it is defended by prodigious earthen ramparts which rise from the field to a height of nearly thirty feet. There is a well in the enclosure, and on the west side a second great rampart. \"It is obviously,\" says Mr. Skene, \" a native strength.\" On its east side the ground slopes down till it comes to the level of the river at a place called Bidding, not quite half a mile off. Between the fort and the village of Carwhinelow is a field extending to the ridge along the stream of that name. This, then, is certainly the \" campus inter Lidel et Carwanolow situato.\" The name of Erydon which Merlin gives to the battle probably remains in Bidding at 113 Vita S. Kentigerni, MSS. Mus.

Looking westward from the fort, the eye rests on the gleaming Solway, and southwards, on the knolls of Arthuret, beyond which the Cumberland hiUs bound the horizon. To Arthuret, then, let us next proceed. For double d in Welsh being equivalent to th, we can hardly now refuse to recognise in it the name of Arderydd117 by which the battle is commonly mentioned. Should any doubt remain, it wdl be dispelled by a visit to the place, which is but some two miles from Longtown. Standing there, on the knolls by Arthuret Church and looking west, with Liddel and Carvanolow behind, a grander battle-plain could hardly be imagined, could the enemy be manoeuvred to attack one in a position of which that eminence should be the centre. In the distance behind and around, low hills, except where they rise to a greater height on the Scotish border ; in front, the Esk, flowing across the pLain, to fad into the Solway Firth, after having been joined by the Line ; and bounding the plain, the sea, into which, should the enemy have been unsuccessful in their attack, the victors, fording the river, might drive them in irreparable rout. At Camelon on the Firth of Forth, we found the site of the battle that closed the career of the historical Arthur in 537. But it was on this scene of the great battle of Arderydd in 573, that it seemed to me, standing on the knolls of Arthuret, that the final Arthurian battle of the Eomancos might best be imagined to have been fought, \u2014 the enemy, driven down from the Moat of Liddel, we have 118 Notice ofthe Site, etc., above quoted, p. 98. 117 Arthuret, as a name, therefore, has nothing whatever to do with Arthur, as Hutchinson supposes (History of Cumberland, v. II. p. 645), making it a corruption of Arthur's head ; and is mentioned among these Arthurian localities, not beoause of its connection with Arthur, but with the Arthurian Merlin."], [89, "S. (n).] 71 ARTHURIAN SCOTLAND. just visited, here making a last stand. For it is Merlin who is the romantic character, pcrr excellence of the Eomances ; and it seemed fitter to make tho scene of the last great battle of the Eomance Arthur the same as that in which Merlin, who is in the Eomances so inti mately connected with Arthur, historically \" bore tho golden torques,\" than to make the scene of that battle which, in its event, was the departing out of this world of all the Arthurian chivalry, the same as that in which the historical Arthur fell, but at which Merlin was not present. And, besides, here we have a great Western Lake, which suits that primitive mythological element which can, I think, be shown cropping-out with singular frequency in the Arthurian Bomance-cycle. With such thoughts, then, I wandered over the old battle plain, past great farms, or rataher agricultural manufactories, with their steam-engines and chimney-stalks, down to and by a primitive wooden bridge mounted on stdts, across the Line. Then, getting on the turnpike- road to Glasgow, I crossed the Esk by an iron bridge, and. a mile or so on the south side of the border, I turned down to- wards the sea, but some five minutes distant now. The scene I beheld as I went down to the tide, \"washing among the reeds,\" struck me as of a weird and magical beauty. Behind, in the middle of the great plain, was still clearly visible the mound of Arthuret ; before me, in the far distance to the right, was the Scotish Criffel, and, to the left, the English Skiddaw ; between these, in the sheen of the setting sun, and stretching away amid points of land to the west, so that, whether it was land-locked as a lake, or boundless as a sea, one could not tell, was the Solway. \u25a0 Here,\" I thought, \" well may one feign that here, even at such a sunset hour as this, after the last fatal battle on the plain above, Excaliber was thrown into the sea ; that here it was caught by the fairy hand, and borne aloft, symbol of the hope, and ultimate triumph of the genius of the Celtic race ; and there, in the infinite Beyond, is A.valon.\""], [90, "72 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. [Ch. III. Coming up to Gretna Green from the Solway, we proceed to Carlisle, which would appear to be the Caer Lliwelydd of the Book of Taliessin,116 and the Cardueil of Eomance, evens tdl more famous than the hardly yet identified Camelot, as the favourite residence c ~ King Arthur. And with reason. For beautifully does the Castle- and Cathedral-crowned eminence, swept round by the Eden, the Peteril, and the Caldew, rise from the wide plain that stretches from the Border Hids down to, and along the Solway Firth. Of the Eden there is a tradition that King Arthur's father tried to turn it out of its course : \" Let Uther-pendragon do what he can, Eden shall run where Eden ran.\" U9 But a visit to the populous modern manufacturing quarter, in the evening, when the hands are loose, (how meaningful is the phrase !) may profitably disturb antiquarian memories, and romantic asso ciations. From Carlisle, near which would appear to have been the Guasmoric of Nennius,120 our Arthurian pdgrimage takes us south ward again through the Inglewood Forest of Eomance. From the Southwaite st<ttion, we have a walk of something more than two mdes, through a beautifuUy-wooded lane, its waysides luxu riant with wild flowers, to the vdlage of Upper Hesket. At the \"White Ox\" I had the good fortune to encounter an in telligent old man, who, taking me to the back of the farm yard, pointed out, down in the hollow, what I was in search of, the famous Tarn Wahethelyne of Ballad and Eomance. But Tarn Wadding, as it has been called in later times, has been for the last ten years a wide meadow, grazed by hundreds of sheep. Of the 118 Four Ancient Books, v. I. p. 257, and v.

Below me was the Tarn ; to the west of It, the ridge of Tipper Hesket ; to the east, an eminence with the site, though no more the ruins, of the Castle Hewin of Eomance, the stronghold of the Grim Baron. And behind this eminence the Eden flows past still another locality that recalls his fame, and, with it, the legend of the Marriage of Sir Gawayne, \u2014Baron- wood. This legend belongs, as I think, to the class of Sun-myths ; and it may be instructive to compare with it that of the Laidley Worm of Spindleston Heugh, near Bamborough Castle, celebrated in tho ballad of 1270 by Duncan Frazier the Bard of Cheviot. As the Foul Lady is transformed into \" the fairest in hall,\" so also is the Laidley Worm, or Loathsome Dragon. For her brother, coming over the Eastern Sea, in a ship with Eowan-tree masts, \" . . . . sheathed bis sword, and bent his bow, And gave her kisses three ; She crept into a hole a Worm, And stepped out a Ladye.\"123 Beturnmg to the Southwaite Station, we proceed next to Pen rith, passing on our way the Plumpton Park and Hatton Hah which Sir Frederic Madden identifies with places of similar names in the Eomances of Sir Gawayne.124 Thence, crossing the narrow but picturesque old bridge of the Eamont, which, flowing from UUeswater, here separates the counties of Westmoreland and Cum berland, we find, closely adjoining the fine Celtic monument of Mayborough, another such set of circular embankments round a flat-surfaced central mound as we found, but on a larger scale, under the battlements of Stirling Castle.

Con tinuing our journey, we come on the Winstor, which is another stream separating the counties of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and would appear to be the Gwensteri of the Book of Taliessin ; 125 as the Derwent should seem to be the Derwennydd of the Go dodin Poems.126 Here we have come to the south-western limit of what I venture to designate Arthurian Scotland. And now, turning northwards, again, I determined, if possible, to verify Sh F. Madden's conjecture that the Grene Chapel spoken of in the Scotish Eomance of Syr Gaioayne and the Grene Knight (by \" Huchowne of the Awle Eyale \" 127?) is the same with the \" Chapel of the Grene,\" which, in the older maps of Cumberland, is marked as existing on the point of land on the western coast, running into the estuary of the Wampool, not far from Skinburness. So from Silloth, which seems to be getting a favourite sea-bathing and health-recruiting place, I wandered up the Solway beach to the extreme point of Skinburness. And this much, at least, by way of verification of Sir F. Madden's conjecture, I may say, that there is near this a beautifully embayed shore, covered with the brightest green down to the very water's edge, from which* if, in deed, the site of the Chapel of the Grene, it might well have taken its name ; and, further, that Volsty or Vulstey Castle, so long as sociated with the necromantic fame of the wizard Michael Scott, and which once stood in the fair wide plain which rises gradually to the foot of Skiddaw, might, from its site with reference to this bright green shore, the seaward border of the plain, well be that in which Sir Gawayne took up his abode, and which is stated to have been but two miles distant from the Grene Chapel, the object of his quest. 125 Four Ancient Books, y.

This district is mentioned in the poems of the Arthurian age as Gallwyddel, of which Galgaidel is the Gaelic, and Galweithia thc Latin form, or equi valent ;133 and it may be described as lying between the Nith and Loch Eyan.134 In the Medi\u00e6val romances, it is referred to as the pa trimony of Sh Gawayne,135 son of Loth, or Lothus, King of Lothian. And thus Galloway may be viewed also as the birthland of the many other knights of whom the only description is but such as this: \"al they were of Scotland, outher of Syr Gawaynes' kynne, outher well-wdlers to his brethren.\"138 The localities, however, which we have to note in this, as also in the next district, belong rather to the Arthurian age than to King Arthur. But the first two I have to mention may be considered as exceptions to this rule, as they refer to S. Kentigern, whom so many traditions connect with Merlin. At Hoddam or Hodelem on the Annan, it is stated by Joceline137 that this saint, on his recall from Wales, after the great Christian victory of Arderydd, placed, for a time, his episcopal seat.

The first of his Memorabilia is ' Stagnum Lumonoy,' or Loch Lomond; and he adds: 'non vadit ex eo ad mare nisi unum flumen quod vocatur Leum' \u2014 that is, the Leven. The Irish Nennius gives the name correctly, Leamhuin, and the Balli mote text gives the name of the town, Cathraig in Leomhan (for Leamhan), the town on the Leven.

Thus we have the old form adhering to the loch and the mountain, while the river adopts the more modern.205 In one of the poems in the Four Ancient Books the Lennox is mentioned as having been given to Taliessin in reward for his songs : \" And a fair homestead, And beautiful clothing, To me has been extended, The lofty Llwyvenydd, And requests open.\"208 Sailing up the JLago Maggiore of Scotland there comes, like a dark shadow, across our delight in the loveliness of its fairy islands, the memory of the tragic story connected with the ruins on the largest of them.

In the first place, we find in the Lennox, on the Firth of Forth, .and in Tweeddale, sites for aU the great battles of the Arthur of History, highly probable, to say the least, both considered separately, and in their sequence. This only I would remark on Mr. Skene's theory as just stated, that, as it seems to me improbable that Arthur had Saxon foes so far west as the Lennox, I would, on this ground, be inclined to prefer the sites given by the writer in the Gentleman's Magazine, as those of his first, and next four battles. But whether we accept Mr. Skene's theory in its entirety, or thus modified, the fact remains that very probable sites may be found for all Arthur's battles, not only in Arthurian Scotland, but just in those districts of it which we know to have formed a debateable land between Cymry, Saxons, and 210 Four Ancient Books, v. I. pp. 68 and 60."], [110, "92 [Ch. HI. ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. Picts during the Arthurian Age. And further, it is to be remarked that at, or in the near neighbourhood of every one of these battle sites thus identified, we find existing, from the time of our oldest charters, and other documents, to this day, places with Arthur's name, or traditions of Arthur's history. Not far from the Glen, we have Arthur's Lee, etc. ; towering over the battle-fields on the Douglas, Ben Arthur ; near the battlefield of Dunnipais (Bassas), as also near that of the final battle of Camlan, Arthur's O'on ; near the fields of battle of the Wood of Celyddon, and of Wedale, the Eddon Hdls with their traditions of the departing out of this world of all the Arthurian Chivalry, and of the coming again of King Arthur ; Dumbarton, where, as above, his ninth battle was fought, bears his name as Arthur's Castle ; near the scene, according to Mr. Skene, of his tenth battle, we find Arthur's Bound Table ; near that of his eleventh battle, Arthur's Seat ; and near his twehth battle-field, the tradition I have above given of Cockleroy HiU. And not only are these battle-sites in the neighbourhood of traditional locali ties, but what is, perhaps, an equally important confirmation of the correctness of these identifications, they are in the neigh bourhood of the great Boman roads.211 We find also, from the foregoing exploration, that the Arthurian Traditions of the various districts, in which so many historical and poetical sites of the Arthurian Age have been identified, are not only distinctively different in each district, but that, in such difference, these traditions are in singular accordance with historical facts. In Strathmore, we have the tradition of Guenivere carried off by the Pictish Mordred ; and the fact of the country beyond the Forth having been in the possession of the Picts. Lothian and GaUoway we find connected by traditions of Lothus and his son Gawayne ; and 211 Compare Eoy, Military Antiquities.

Cumberland is distinguished by traditions of the Court of King Arthur, of which Gawayne, who is particularly mentioned as \" of Scotland,\" \" de l'Escosse,\" in the French Eomances, is the principal hero ; and Cumberland marched with his patrimony of Galloway. The Isle of Man is spoken of as inhabited by a foreign and hostile race ; and it was in fact inhabited, not as the mainland by Cymry, but by Irish Scots. And so on. I do not, indeed, know of any tradi tion of Arthurian Scotland which, in its general features at least, is not in accordance with the results of our later historical researches. This accordance between topographical tradition and historical fact wdl be further dlustrated in the foUowing chapter, in which the results wiU briefly be given of the later investigation of that Ossianic poetry and Fingahan tradition, which, as pointed out in Chapter H. Section (n), would have been a condition inimical to the importation into the North of Arthurian tradition, if it had else where had its birthland. And, as a stdl further confirmation of the theory of this Essay, I shall, in the concluding chapter, more par ticularly show that all the chief incidents of the Arthurian Eomances find in Scotland fit traditional localities, and that with \" the North \" are also connected all the chief characters of these Eomances, with the exception, perhaps, of Sh Tristrem.

[Ch. IV. CHAPTEE IV. THE FINGALIAJSI RELATIONS OP ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES AS PRESENTED BY AN EXAMINATION OF PICTISH MEMOEIALS. Thus I have shewn, first, that the critical results of the examina tion of Cymric history, political and literary, point to what is now Southern Scotland and the English Border, as the scene of the events which were the historical bases of the Arthurian traditions ; and, secondly, that the theory deduced from this historical and literary criticism has what may be justly regarded as an inductive verifica tion in the results of the journeying narrated in the foregoing pages. And I would now proceed to point out those Fingalian relations of the Arthurian topography of Scotland which are presented by an examination of Pictish Memorials. I shaU show that, as the tra ditions of Arthur and Merlin are what still lives for us of the Cymry of the south, the traditions of Fingal and Ossian are the still living memorials of the Picts of the north of Scotland : that Scotland beyond the northern boundary of what the localities just pointed-out suggest that we should call Arthurian Scotland, should, if it is to be similarly named from its traditional topography, be distinguished as Fingalian ; and that the Cymry and Picts to whom the Arthurian and Fingailian cycles of Celtic Mythology respectively belong, were of kindred Celtic race and language, and in geographical relations to each other in Scotland simdar to those which are now found to exist between the ./Arthurian and Fingalian topographies of that country. SECTION (i). The Belation of the Feinne to thc Picts. I have first, thon, to show that the Fingalian traditions would appear to connect themselves with the Picts of the north, in the"], [113, "S. (i).] PICTISH MEMORIALS. 95 same manner as the Arthurian traditions are certainly derived, whether originally or not, from the Cymry of the south of Scotland. For the question as to the real position of the Ossianic poems in the literature of Scotland depends, as Mr. Skene has pointed out, on the answer to the preliminary question : \" Who were the Feinne, the Fenians, or Fingahans of tradition, and to what country and period are they to be assigned ? \" 1 And his investigation of this question ends in the conclusion that, whether a denomination for an entire people, or for a body of warriors, the Feinne belonged to the Cruithne, or Picts, the race prior to the Low Germans in Lochhn, or Scandinavia, and the seaboard north of the Ehine, and to the Scots in Alban, or northern Scotland, Breatan, or southern Scotland, and Erin, or Ireland. Hence, the Ossianic poems, and Fingalian traditions, appear as celebrating Pictish heroes, and recording, in a legendary form, events of early Pictish history. And hence, the Feinne, or Fenians, and the traditions which form the groundwork, at least, of the Ossianic poems, \" belong to that period in the history of Scotland and Ireland before a political separation had taken place between them, when they were viewed as parts of one territory, though physicaUy separated, and when a free, and uninterrupted intercourse took place between them.\" As to how the Scotish G\u00e6lic, in which these Fingalian traditions and poems have been transmitted, originated in the undalriadic parts of the Highlands ; Mr. Skene remarks that, 'if the supposition be correct that the Cruithne, or Picts, spoke a Gaelic dialect, we can easdy understand how, though originaUy different from the Gaelic dialect of Dalriada, it may, by the influence of the written language, and its vernacular use by the clergy for so long a period, have become modified, and assimdated to it.\" Whether the historical events in which the Fingalian traditions originated, occurred in Alban or Erin, on the eastern, or on the 1 Book of the Dean of Lismore, p.

IV. western side of the narrow seas dividing the ancient Pictland of the centuries preceding the sixth, is, I would submit, a question which can be scientifically determined only by foUowing some such method as that I have stated, and exemplified, in this attempt to discover the original birthland of the Arthurian traditions. First, there must be deduced from the criticism of the earliest historical sources, the time, character, and place of the events which may have been the actual bases of these traditions; and secondly, this deduction must be verified by the results of a thorough study of the Fin galian topography, both of Scotland and of Ireland ; the assumption being that, where there is the greatest number of Fingalian locali ties, there the events occurred in which Fingalian traditions origi nated, except such abundance of local tradition can be otherwise more prob.ibly explained. That, however, the Scots under whom the various Celtic and Teutonic races of North Britain are found, at the opening of the Medi\u00e6val age, consolidated into one predominantly Celtic nationality, were Irish immigrants who settled in what is now Argyllshire, in the sixth century, would appear to be certain ; and that these Irish Scots belonged originaUy to a southern stream of migration by Syria, Africa, and Spain, from the Asian cradle of the Aryan race, would appear to be not improbable. But on the other hand, the Picts, or Cruithne, \u2014 with whom the Fenian legends and Ossianic poetry are by so many indications, if not positive proofs, connected, \u2014 would ap pear to have originally belonged to a northern stream of migration, by Scythia and Germany, or Lochlin. And hence, as, for the Scots of Albany or North Britain, Erin or Ireland was the parent country ; so, for the Picts of Erin, Albany would be the colonising fatherland. We know, at leabt, as historical facts, that, as the Scots of Albany became independent of those of Erin in 578. the Picts of Erin threw off the yoke of those of Albany in 608.2 And the infer- 2 See Skene, Chronicles of the Picts and Scots."], [115, "S.

The question at least suggests itself, whether, in like manner, as, though all the MSS. of ancient Cymric literature are Welsh, yet the original localities of its Arthu rian poems would seem to be found in Southern Scotland ; so, though the greater part of the MSS. of ancient Gaelic literature are Irish, yet the original localities of its Fingalian traditions may not be found in Western (and Northern) Scotland, rather than in Ireland ? But whether the historical bases of the Fingalian traditions were events which actually occurred in the third, or some later, century ; whether the scene of these events was Albain, or Erin, or both ; and whether, therefore, it is Scotland, or Ireland, or neither exclusively, that was the birthland of the Fingalian traditions ; must, for the present, be left as questions to which nc definitive answer can be given. Certain, however, it is that Scotland has not only an equal claim with Ireland to an Ossianic poetry3 in which Fingalian heroes have been \" celebrated in Gaelic verse ever since the ninth century, if not the seventh;\"4 but that Scotland alone can lay claim to what I would call the Fingalian Epic, the Gaelic \" Ossian,\" published from MacPherson's MSS. in 1807 as the original of his translation of 17G2. And this epicising of old Ossianic fragments, for such the Gaelic \" Ossian \" has now been shown to be, must be at least admitted to be a work of very great historical importance. 3 In answer to Professor O'Curry's somewhat hasty remark \u2014 \" Of all MacPherson's translations, in no single instance has a genuine Scotish original been found, and that none will ever be found I am very certain \" (MS.

And that must rank as a Scoto-Gaelio work at least a hundred years old, and tdl the contrary is proved, Ireland has not a ghost of a claim to it.9 As to MacPherson's personal character, it may not, under all the circumstances of the case, be going too far aside from our present subject to add that, though he would have had a far more desirable fame, had he \" had the courage to .avow the truth, and state candidly to the world how much of his work was based on original authority, .and to what extent he had carried the process of adapting, inter polating, and weaving into epic poems ; \" 9 yet, in mitigation of our judgment, it is but fair to remember that, in his time, there was not yet that scrupulous truthfulness in antiquarian research which, but a manifestation as it is of the general increase of the scientific spirit, is characteristic of these days ; and further, that the out rageous violence of the attacks led by the prejudiced, overbearing, and in this matter, utterly ignorant Saxon, Dr. Johnson,10 was not calculated to encourage a candour which would have been certainly represented as a confession of forgery.

We find that Scotland has, besides its Arthurian traditions, an Ossianic hterature which has, through MacPherson, exercised a most important European influence ; that this hterature is sounded on Fenian or Fingalian legends which are still current as popular tales in the West Highlands ; that the Feinne, who are the heroes of these legends, belonged to the race of the Picts ; that, as Scotland was the fatherland of the Picts who 11 Mr. Skene speaks of \"the wonderful tact and originality Macpherson really showed in producing his English version.\" Book of Dean of Livnore, p. liii.

The Belation of Fingalian to Arthurian Topography. I have now to show that Scotland north and west of the line of the Grampians is as distinctively Fingalian in its topography, as, south and east of that line, we have found it to be Arthurian. To attempt to give anything like a complete list of the Fenian locali ties of Scotland would be here irrelevant. It will be sufficient for my present purpose to show that they are found more or less thickly over the whole of Scotland beyond that part of it which is distinguished by an Arthurian topography ; and further, that these Fingahan localities are not found within, though some of them are on the outskirts of, the Arthurian country. Let me, then, imagine those who have accompanied me in my Arthurian journey to con tinue their wanderings into Fingalian Scotland. Sailing down Loch Lomond, we find overlooking the islands at its southern end, a hdl caUed Dun Fion, or the Fort of Fingal. Thence, through the Lennox by Glen Fruin, the \" Glen of Sorrow,\" 14 Skene, History of the Highlanders. Compare v. I. chap. IV. and v. II. chap. VI.

Then, across Loch Long, up Loch Goil, and so, by HeU's Glen, to Inverary on Loch Fyne. Here one might enumerate in one view a long hst of Fin galian localities; Cruach -Fhinn, Innis-Chonain, Innis Addhe, Innis Baoine, Innis Chonnad, etc. Crossing again into Co wall we find it \"stdl brimful of Fenian traditions.\" And here, particularly, we come on the first of those localities so tenderly commemorated in the Lament of Deirdre over jAlban, which is the foundation of MacPherson's \"Darthula,\" and of which there is a copy in the Glenmasan MS. of the year 1238, now in the Advocates' Library. \" Glendaruadh ! 0 Glendaruadh ! My love each man of its inheritance, Sweet the voice of the cuckoo on bending bough, On the hill above Glendaruadh.\" l6 Thence, sading down the Kyles of Bute, and crossing the southern end of Loch Fyne to Tarbert, we observe, in the distance, the beautiful island of Arran, Ar-ain, or Ar-fhinn, Fin's Land, where there is another Dun Fion. Exploring the neighbourhood of West Loch Tarbert we remark that it is especiaUy distinguished by its traditions of Diarmid, the Lancelot of Arthurian Eomance, and Mordred of Arthurian Tradition. Here we find Leaba Dhiarmaid, \" the Bed of Diarmid ; \" Leum na Muice, \" the Swine's Leap ; \" Tor na Tuirc, \" the Boar's Heap,\" where the boar was killed by Diarmid ; and Sliabh Ghavd, \" the HiU of Love,\" to which the wounded hero is said to have addressed, as he was dying, hnes stiU preserved by tradition. Near this also, is Dun 'a Choin Duibh, \" the Fort of the Black Dog,\" which is a curious old fort in a wood, and is said to be the place where Bran kdled the black dog, as is told in a well known ballad. Wandering up Knapdale we find, on Loch Swine 14 Book of the Dean of Lismore, p. xxxv."], [121, "S. (n).] 103 PICTISH MEMORIALS. the Dun Suibhne of baUad and song. A short distance to the north, we find the site of the ancient capital of the Scotish kingdom of Dalriada, the hdl fort of Dunadd, called also from its situation in the centre of the Moss of Crinan, Dunmonaidh, or \" the Fort of the Moss.\" And thence, getting to Loch Awe, we find its shores and islands, as romantic in Fingalian legend as in natural scenery;18 Innis Fraoch, particularly, recalling a legend wonderfully similar to that of Hercules and the garden of the Hesperides. The story is finely told by an ancient bard in a composition usually called \" Bas Fraoich,\" or The Death of Fraoch, and beginning : \"The sigh of a friend from Fraoch's green mound, 'Tis the warrior's sigh from his lonely bier, 'Tis a sigh might grieve the manly heart, And might make the maid to weep.\" 1T Wandering on, through the Pass of Brander, at the foot of Ben Cruachan, we come down on Loch Etive, the Loch Eitche of the Lament of Deirdre, and the Lora of the Fingahan Epic. At its southern end is Dunstaffnage Castle, more properly Dun-da-innis from two islands near it, \u2014 the Dun Lora of Ossian. The Ferry \u2014 over the rocks of which the ebb-tide thunders with deafening roar \u2014 is the FaUs, and the moor on the other side is the Heath, of Lora with its dark gray stones, \u2014 the Eas Laoire, and Sliabh Eas Laoire of Mac- Pherson's Gaehc Fingal. Not far from this also is the Luath, another of Ossian's streams. And Dun mhic Uisneachan, now corruptly caUed in guidebooks, Dun MacSniachan, and also named Bad-an-righ, \" the King's house or town,\" seems with great proba bility identified with the Selma and Taura of Ossian, and with the Beregonium of ancient writers. Of the same Pictish, and Fingahan Uisneach, we have another record near this in Glen Uisneach. And it is to be noted that the legends of his three sons, Ainle, Ardun, and Naoise, connect them with those remarkable structures termed 18 See the notes to Hamekton's Loch Awe and other Poems. 17 Book ofthe Dean of Lismore, p. 54 and p. 36."], [122, "104 [Ch.

Proceeding to Oban, we may take the steamer round Mull to the sacred, but tourist-profaned Iona,18 and to that sublime sea-cave which bears the name of Fingal. Betuming through the Sound of MuU, we have on our left the Morvern, so often mentioned in the Fin galian Epic, but unknown in the Fingalian baUads and tales. In the island of Liosmor, or Lismore, however, which gave its name to the deanery of that Sh James MacGregor who, in the sixteenth century, made the valuable collection, recently edited, of Gaelic poetry, then ancient, we have more genuine Fingahan localities. Larach tigh nam Fiann, \" the Site of the Fingalians' House,\" is a large circular mound of some eighty yards diameter, surrounded by a ditch, and having near its centre a deep weU which may have been used for the purpose of entrapping game in this traditionaUy favourite hunting ground of the Fingalians. And in pleasant conjunction with these memorials of the chase is here also found Sliabh nam Ban Fionn, \"the Fingalian Fair Women's HiU.\" Coasting the shores of Appin, and sailing up another of the many Lakes of Elms (Loch Leven), we land at Ballachulish, and thence walk to Glen Coe (Gleann Comhan), \"the Narrow Glen.\" Here tradition fitly places the birth-place of Ossian, \" the sweet voice of Cona ; \" and among the sublime precipices that wall the Glen on the east is Ossian's Cave. Journeying up the Glen, to where it opens on the Moor of Ean noch, and turning down next day through the Black Mount Forest, we come to Glen Orchy, another of the localities of the Lament of Deirdre. Thence, through Glen Dochart, to Cill Fhinn, pro nounced in Gaelic, and written in Enghsh Killin, \" Fingal's Tomb.\" And in the neighbourhood we find a place called Sornach-coir- 18 This island is the property of the Duke of Argyll ; and one can hardly believe that his Grace, so eminent as he is for wide culture and high feeling, can be aware of the neglected and unguarded state in which the most ancient monuments ofthe Scotish monarchy are hero going to ruin.

Fhinn, \"Fingal's Oven.\" Proceeding up Loch Tay, we come to the Kirkton of Fortingall, anciently the Clachan of Fothergill, where was born that Dean of Lismore, to whose MS. of the sixteenth centmy we are so much indebted. To the West of this is Glen Lyon, the ancient Cromgleann nan Clach, or \" Crooked Glen of the Stones,\" associated with so many traditions of the Feinne, and where the remains of their rude forts, termed Caistealan na Feinne, crown many a rocky summit. And the vale is bounded on the south and east by the heights of Drum Fhionn, or \" Fingal's Bidge.\" Turning again southwards, \" in that awful part of Glen Almon where lofty and impending cliffs on either hand make a solemn, and almost perpetual gloom,\" 19 is found Clachan Ossian, \" the grave-stone of Ossian ;\" and one of the neighbouring hills is called Monivaird, or \" the Bard's HiU.\" About three miles from Clach Ossian in a glen named Corriviarlich is Fingal's Cave; and on the other side of the .Almon in Strathearn, is a small village named Fendoch, anciently Fianntach, \"Fingal's Thatch-house or Hall,\" where, according to the tradition, the king came to reside after the Bad-an-Bigh above mentioned had been burned down by Garbh MacStairn. In the Aberdeenshire Highlands, I may note, among other localities, Bengulbain in Glen Shee, with its tradition of the famous boarhunt of Diarmid O'Duine \u2014 \" Then bravely did the hero of the Feinn Rouse from his cover on the mountain-side, The great old boar, him so well known in Shee, The greatest in the wild-boar's haunt e'er seen.\" 20 Ben-Muich-Dhui is \" the HiU of the Black Sow.\" And on the north side of the upper vaUey of the Dee, in the Forest of Glen Avon, and overlooking Inchrory, is Clach Bhean, \" the HiU of the Woman's Stone,\" with its legend of Fingal's wife, Grainne, the \" victim,\" (?) of Diarmid.

I marked the direction of the welcome sound; and fording the river, made straight to where it seemed to come from. In Moray, which so long remained Pictish, is a place caUed Tuber na Fein, which in an old gloss to a charter of Alexander IL, of the year 1220, stiU preserved in the chartulary of the Bishopric, is ex plained to mean \" the Well of the Great or Kempis Men.\" Loch Ness, near which was the Pictish capital, should seem to be named after Naoise, the son of Uisneach, above mentioned. In Boss-shire, there is Gleann Chonnain \"Connan's vale;\" and jAmhain Chonnain, \"Connan's river;\" and even Gleann Bhrain, in honour of Fingal's celebrated dog, Bran. Beturning southward, we find, to the south of Loch Ness, and in Glen Boy, other Ben Gulbains, with their traditions of \"The blue-eyed hawk that dwelt at Es?aroy,\"21 which also is in this district. And traveUing westward, as we bring these wanderings to a close, we find in Glen Elg, or Gleann Eilig, \"the Glen of the Elk,\" a place caUed Iomaire-nam-fearmor, \"the Big Men's Bidge,\" where tradition says that two of the Fingalians, who were drowned in crossing Caol-reathain, are buried. Crossing to Skye, we come into the country of Cuchullin, whom tradition con nects with Dun Scathaig, another of those so-called vitrified forts. And now, looking out on the Atlantic, wo may behold such sea pictures as that so graphically described in the five words of the ancient line \u2014 \" Sgaoth eunlaith nir steuda saile \" A skiff of birds on steeds of brine. \" As each long Atlantic wave comes roUing in, we may see a clump 21 Book os the Dean of Lismore, p. 33."], [125, "S.

Tlie Belation of the Picts to the Cymry. Having thus briefly indicated the relations of the Feinne to the Picts, and of the Fingahan to the Arthurian topography of Scotland, we have now to point out the relations of the Picts to the Cymry in race, language, and geographical position. From the evidence of writers cotemporaneous with their existence as a known and dis tinct people ; from the analysis of such remains of their language as have come down to us ; and from the inference to be drawn from the topography of the districts which they are known to have occupied ; Mr. Skene arrives at the conclusion that the Picts were of the Gadhaelic branch of the Celtic race ; but that their language was, to use the nomenclature by which Grimm distinguishes the leading differences of the German dialects, a low Gadhaelic, and hence approached in many of its forms to the low Cymric of the Welsh; Cornish, and Armorican, or Breton, representing the high Cymric dialects ; as the Gaehc, the Irish, and the Manx, repre sent the high Gadhaelic dialects. And in opposition to the popular view of the demarcation be tween a Cymric and a Gadhaelic population supposed to be indi cated by the occurrence of the words aber and inver, Mr. Skene shows that there were three words, aber, inver, and conber, ex pressive of the junction of one stream with another, and all formed from the old Celtic word ber, signifying water; and that what we actuaUy find is, the Scots of the west with nothing but invers, the Picts of the north with abers and invers together, and the 22 Campbell, West Highland Tales, v.

Cymry south of the Forth and Clyde with no abcrs.23 Such, as far as can be ascertained, should seem to have been the relations of the Picts in race, and language, to the Cymry.24 And if this conclu sion is still not free of doubt, it would now appear to be, at least established, that the Picts belonged to tbe Celtic, and not, as maintained by Pinkerton, and other eminent antiquaries of a former generation, to the Teutonic Famdy. It is but fair, however, to say that Mr. Irving, in his History of Scotish Poetry, stiU adheres to the Teutonic theory ;25 and that Mr. Burton, in his History of Scotland, expresses himself scepticady with reference to all the solutions of the question hitherto offered ; and points to the \" close examination lately given to the vestiges of ancient art as promising better residts \" \u2014 the most ancient types of the sculptured stones being \" found in the territory inhabited by the Picts.\"28 Yet, on the whole, considering the arguments and critical results brought forward by Eobertson, MacLachlan, Skene, and others, who appear tc have far more fully investigated the subject than either Mr. Irving or Mr. Burton, the weight of evidence ap pears to me, as I have said, to incline to the Celtic theory of the race-relations of the \" Painted People.\" But two points, which I do not remember to have seen particularly noticed in their connection with each other, have struck me as, at least, curious, \u2014 the accord ance of the Celtic meaning of Fingalians, White Strangers,2'1 with the famous description by Tacitus \u2014 \" Habitus corporum varii ; atque ex eo arguments : namque rutil\u00e6 Caledoniam habitantium com\u00e6, magni artus, Germanicam originem adseverant ;\"28 \u2014 and the occurrence of a 23 Four Ancient Books, y.

All this, however, would only go to prove, what is otherwise highly probable, that the northern stream of Celtic migration were a fair-haired, and large-limbed people, and that they got in some degree mixed with the Teutonic tribes with whom they came in contact, and were, as it should seem, occasionally in aUiance.30 That the Picts, therefore, were Celts, and of the Gadhaelic branch, would appear to be the most just conclusion from our present knowledge. The geographical relations of these two kindred Celtic races were, in the Pre-medi\u00e6val Age, mainly determined by those eastern and western estuaries of the Forth and the Clyde which, according to the remark of Tacitus, almost make of the region to the north of them a separate island. There was, however, also a Pictish population among the Cymry of the south between Loch Eyan and the Nith, apparently the remains of a time when Picts possessed the whole northern half of Britain. But, though Pictish Celts be yond the Forth and Clyde, and Cymric Celts to the south of these Firths, were thus the bases of the Scotish nationality ; there were also two other elements, the geographical relations of which to these two chief races of North Britain, in the Pre-medi\u00e6val Age, must be here pointed out. Between the Cymric States of the south and the eastern sea, was the kingdom of Bernicia with its Saxon population extending from the Tyne, to the Firth of Forth, and the Esk. And on the south-western side of the Dorsum Britanni\u00e6, the great mountain chain of Drumalban, or Backbone of Albion, the Picts had for menacing neighbours, though of kindred Celtic 29 C. xxxi. 30 See as to the connection between Vecta and the Vecturiones, as ono of the two gentes of the Picts, Four Ancient Books, v.

In the centre of what, in the tenth century, towards the end of this Pre-medi\u00e6val Age, is first mentioned as Scotland,31 these four races met on a sort of neutral ground, comprising the modern counties of Stirling and Linlithgow, and occupied by a mixed population of Picts, Saxons, and Cymry. Into this debateable land the kings of the Scots also frequently carried their arms ; in it lay the smaU districts of Calatria and Manann ; and within its limits most of the battles were fought in which the different races encountered each other in the struggle for the mastery.32 From the eighth to the tenth century another Teutonic element, besides that of the Lothians and the East coast, was added to the population of Scotland in the settlement on the Orkneys, and on the Western Islands and Mainland, of the Norsemen, driven to be vikings or sea-robbers,33 by the conquests of Charlemagne, and the tyranny of Gorm, Earic, and Harald Harfager, in attempting to consolidate the petty states of Scandivania into the respective king doms of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.34 But this Teutonic element also was ultimately so completely absorbed that the most Celtic part of Scotland is now those very highlands aud islands where the Norsemen were at one time supreme. It belongs to the history of the formation of the Scotish nationality, to show how the mastery 31 Supra, p. 25, n. 14. 32 As it was in this great plain also that Bannockburn, and the other great battles of the Medi\u00e6val, and subsequent centuries, wero fought, Dean Stanley compares with it the great battle-field of Palestine, the plain of Esdraelon, or Armageddon.

But we may here remark that though the Norsemen have been absorbed, we may stdl observe traces of Scandinavian influences. For, as we have memorials of the Picts in Fingalian, and of the Cymry in Arthu rian Scotland, so, in what I may caU Odinian Scotland, have we memorials of the Norsemen. But this, not in a Norse topography, \u2014 except occasionaUy such a name as Thurso, \u2014 but in Norse super stitions.35 That the Teutonic mythology has left its traces only in superstitious customs, while the Celtic mythology has its memorials chiefly in topographical traditions, depends, partly at least, on es sential differences between these two mythologies which I hope, in another essay, to have an opportunity of pointing out. Meantime, I cannot, without undue divergence from my present subject, do more than note the fact that those wars of races which, through out Europe, occupied the Pre-medi\u00e6vfd Age, and which ended in France with the constitution of a Eomanic, and in England of a Teu tonic nationality, terminated in Scotland in the establishment of a Celtic monarchy ;36 and I can here only point to the important bear ing of this fact on the topographical preservation in Scotland alone of the traditions both of Fingal and of Arthur, and hence, of tales belonging to both the great branches of Celtic Mythology. We find, therefore, first, that Fingalian traditions connect them selves with the Picts, or, at least, with a body of warriors be longing to that race ; secondly, that the Fingalian localities of Scotland are not only spread more or less thickly over, but are confined to, the non-Arthurian region ; and thirdly, that the Picts, like the Cymry, were a Celtic race; that, speaking generally, the stdl-existing Fingalian and Arthurian divisions of Scotland coincide with its Pre-medi\u00e6val Pictish and Cymric divisions ; that is, with 35 Burton, v. I. pp. 232 et seq. M See above, p. 3, n. 5, and p. 27, n. 16."], [130, "112 [Ch. IV. ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. its divisions as occupied by those races to whom we have traced Fingalian and Arthurian traditions respectively. And this limita. tion of the Arthurian topography of Scotland to the ancient Cymric kingdoms of the North becomes the more remarkable when we con sider the apparent exceptions to the rule. For, as we have seen, the Arthurian localities at Alyth, at Meigle, and near Forfar, \u2014 all un doubtedly in the country of the Picts \u2014 tell us of Guenivere wiUingly carried off by the Pictish king Mordred, and pursued, and punished by Arthur. Again we have Arthurian traditions connected with Galloway, which was a southern Pictish province or petty kingdom^ But whom do these traditions concern but Gawayne, the son of Loth, the Pictish king of Lothian, and the brother (or half-brother) of Mordred ? Do not then, such accordances between Scotish Arthurian traditions, and Pre-medi\u00e6val historical facts prove a further confirmation of the theory in this essay maintained, as to the historical origin of Arthurian localities ? Again, this chapter will, I trust, have brought out more clearly that his torical condition inimical to the importation into the North of Ar thurian tradition which was but briefly alluded to in Section (n.) of Chapter IL, namely \u2014 the existence among the conquering race of the Scots of a poetical literature and historical tradition opposed to that of the Cymry, whose language began to die out in Scotland with the subversion of their native Church in the eighth century. May we not, then, in concluding this chapter, repeat, with additional force, the question, how, except on the hypothesis of the Arthurian traditions having originated in historical events belonging to tho Cymric kingdoms of tho North, can we explain, not merely the existence of an abundant Arthurian topography in Scotland, but the strict limitation of that topography to the Cymric kingdoms of the Pro-medi\u00e6val Age, and its remarkable relation to the Fingalian topography of the ancient Pictish monarchy? I trust, therefore, that the Fingalian relations of Arthurian locali-"], [131, "Ch. V.] 113 THE NEW HELLAS. ties which I have, in this chapter, pointed- out, may be found to have not only a general interest and suggestiveness, but to afford such a confirmation of my theory of the origin of these localities, as to justify the relevanoy of these pages on Pictish Memorials. CHAPTEE V. CONCLUSION \u2014 THE NEW HELLAS. Thus the question which arose from our preliminary survey of the Old Arthurland\u2014 namely, which of its three divisions, that of Scotland, of England, or of France, was the birthland of Arthurian tradition ? \u2014 should seem to be definitively answered. Or, if this is not admitted, it wiU, I trust, at least be granted that the number of Arthurian locahties now, for the first time, pointed-out in Scotland, has an interest quite independent of our theory of the origin of Arthurian traditions ; and further, that the method em ployed in attempting to solve the problem of the historical origin of these traditions, has the advantage of raising two perfectly definite issues, namely \u2014 first, whether the above-stated critical results can, in accordance with all ascertained or ascertainable facts bearing on the subject, be maintained or not ? and, secondly, whether the exist ence of so numerous Arthurian localities in Scotland can be otherwise more probably explained, than on the hypothesis of the historical Arthur having been a leader of the northern Cymry ? But though the theory above set-forth is certainly that which seems to me to have the best and surest ground, I desire to add that, whde endea vouring to state and defend this theory with aU possible clearness, I would not be understood as affirming it -with any degree of unscien tific dogmatism. And should the only effect of this essay be to stir up so-je Welsh or Breton antiquary to refute its conclusions, be it so ; let knowledge increase, and truth prevad. It wiU be desirable, however, before proceeding to the main subject of this chapter \u2014 the 8"], [132, "114 [Ch. V. ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. illustration of the unity and completeness of Scotish Arthurian Localities \u2014 to point-out the ethnological relations of Arthurian Scotland. Its geological relations wiU be briefly indicated in the third section. SECTION (I.) The Ethnological Belations of Arthurian Scotland. First, then, in order that, at least, the prejudices of a false patriotism may not impede the acceptance of this theory of the origin of Arthurian localities, it may be weU briefly to show how especially unreasonable such prejudice would, in this case, be. From Breton antiquaries, indeed^one cannot fear that this theory wdl meet with a preiudiced criticism ; for not only have the Bretons, M. de la Vdlemarque and M. Ernest Eenan, shown themselves regardless of the petty distinc tions of Celtic race, or rather tribe; but it is, if not to France, so undisputedly to writers in French,1 that we owe the moulding of the rude Cymric traditions and legends into their European shape, as Arthurian Eomances, that it can hardly be a matter of national prejudice how much, or how little, of these original legends and traditions belonged to Brittany. But why, except, of course, on clear scientific grounds, should Welsh antiquaries, merely as Welsh men, view with disfavour a theory which makes Southern Scotland and the English Border the historical birthland of Arthurian tradi tion ? That which chiefly gives this theory a reasonable foundation, is the fact of the extension of the Cymric kingdoms, in the Pre medi\u00e6val Age, so far beyond the limits of modern Wales, away to the Firths of Forth and Clyde. To show, therefore, the Enghsh Border and Southern Scotland to be so rich in Arthurian localities 1 The distinction is important ; for two of the greatest of these writers, 'Walter Map and Robert do Borron, belonged to the Anglo-Norman Court of Henry II. De Borron would appear to have been an ancestor of Byron's, See Pearson, Seynt Graal, y. II. (Roxburgh Club)."], [133, "S. (i).] THE NEW HELLAS. 115 as to give strong probability to the theory that, in this region of the old Cymry-land, the Arthurian traditions originated, is thus, surely, not to rob the Cymry of the modern Principality of any thing to which even prejudice can attach itself, but, on the con trary, to add to their historic importance and renown. And as for the Anglo-Saxon prejudice that this essay may en counter, this, of aU others, is founded on mistake. The term \" Anglo- Saxon \" is accurately apphed to but a single early period of English history.2 \" Anglo-Saxon,\" as applied to the modern British people, and Britannic race, I believe every impartial scholar wdl agree with me in thinking a gross misnomer. For if it can be shewn that there is a large Celtic element even in the population of England itself,3 stdl more unquestionable is this, not only with regard to the population of the British Isles generaUy, but also with reference to the English speaking peoples of America and Australasia. Even the Enghsh are rather Anglo-Celts than Anglo-Saxons ; and stdl more certainly is Anglo-Celtic a more accurate term than Anglo-Saxon, not only for that British nationality which includes the Scots, the Irish, and the Welsh ; but also for that Britannic race, chief elements in the forma tion of which have been Welsh, Scotish, and Irish immigrants. It may, perhaps, be affirmed that this term \"Anglo-Saxon\" is justified, if not by the numerical and merely quantitative, at least by the intel lectual and qualitative predominance of this element in our variously composed race and nationality. But, I venture to think, that such an affirmation wiU not bear a comparison with facts. Just let one take the trouble to reckon up for this, and the last two or three genera tions, the so-caUed \" Englishmen,\" or \" Anglo-Saxons \" who have been most distinguished, and have exercised the widest influence in the various directions of inteUectual activity, philosophical and 2 See PejUSSOn, History of England in the Early and Middle Ages, v. I., in which Anglo-Saxon has its true application in contradistinction to Anglo-Danish, and Anglo- Norman. 3 See Nicholl, Pedigree of the English."], [134, "[Ch. V. 116 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. literary, political and mditary, legal and commercial. I believe that, if his list is candidly and impartiaUy made out, he will be surprised to find how many of these \" EngUshmen \" must be set down as, on one side, or on both, Scotsmen ; how many also, Irishmen or Welshmen ; and surprised to find how many even of the great Englishmen, if their ancestry is looked into, are, if not almost as much Anglo- Celts as the Scots, Irish, or Welsh, most certainly, at least, not Anglo- Saxons. It should seem time, therefore, for every one who cares for true speech \u2014 speech in accordance with the realities of things \u2014 to abandon this unhappy falsehood about Anglo-Saxons, and to speak rather of Anglo-Celts. No doubt history, particularly religious history, affords many instances of utter fictions having, for a time at least, very beneficial effects. It is needless here to give examples. But, in these days, when the chief political and social questions that occupy us are being raised by the most Celtic element in the com monwealth, it were surely weU to cease using a term which is not only scientificaUy false, but practically pernicious. It was not wholly without reason that the old necromancers believed that there was in words a magical power. This, however, by the way. What here more particularly con cerns us is the fact that, in that district of the British Isles which I have called Arthurian Scotland, not only are all the Celtic races \u2014 Cymry, Picts, and Irish Scots \u2014 found along with Teutonic Angles in the Pre-medi\u00e6val Age ; but that, afterwards, both the conquered Saxons and the conquering Normans of England were, by the policy of the Scotish kings, so freely invited and generously beneficed as settlers, that there is no district in Britain which belongs less to any one only of the various elements of the British population ; and that here alone have all those elements freely met, and indistin guishably mingled. Whatever the primitive race, therefore, with which we may consider ourselves to be more particularly connected, we shaU find records of our ancestors in Arthurian Scotland."], [135, "S. (ii).] THE NEW HELLAS. 117 SECTION (il). The Unity and Completeness of Scotish Arthurian Localities. But now, one of those results of this investigation, briefly alluded to in the first chapter as giving interest to the solution of the question proposed,1 must be moro particularly noted. For whether I am right or not in the theory of Southern Scotland being the historical birthland of Arthurian tradition; to have shown how numerous are the Arthurian localities of Scotland; and to have pointed out the unique relation that here exists between Arthurian and Fingalian Topography, ought, I venture to think, to be alone sufficient to make Arthurian Scotland the classic land of those who may hereafter make use of the Arthurian Eomances as the formal material of their poetic creations. And, as it wdl not only bring this result more clearly home to my readers, but will afford no slight confirmation to the historical theory in this Essay maintained, it wdl not be irrelevant to show, in conclusion, that Scotland is not only in the mere number of localities the chief country of Arthurian Tradition ; but that there is a very singular unity and completeness in its Arthurian topography in reference to the various characters, tales, and incidents, of the whole cycle of Arthurian Eomance. To see, however, the unity and completeness of these traditional localities, we must first have reduced to some order the Arthurian legends and romantic tales themselves. They wiU, I think, be found very distinctly divisible into six classes. As either the first or last class of these legends, we may consider those which relate to the enchanted sleep, and resurrection of the Arthurian chivalry. Then we have the five classes of adventures to which, borrowing the title of the lost work of the early Scotish poet, \" Huchowne of the Awle Eyale,\" we may give the name of \" The Great Geste of Arthur.\" The first class of the adventures of the \" Great Geste,\" includ ing the various stories of the forest hfe of Merlin and the young 4 Supra, pp. 14 and 15."], [136, "118 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. (Ch. V. Arthur ; the loves of both master and pupd ; the election of Arthur as king ; the victory of the national cause, of which he is the representative ; his marriage and the establishment of the Table Eounde, we may conveniently distinguish under the title of the Eomance of the Forest, or the Youth of Arthur. Then we find in these legends and tales a great number of scenes, incidents, and characters, which belong to all the various kinds into which the systematic Germans have, in their treatises on \u00e6sthetics, classified Das Komische. Of this part of the \" Great Geste,\" at once the most prominent and heroic character is, at least in the earlier romances, that noble Don Giovanni, the gay knight of Galloway, the courteous Sir Gawayne; and its most important incidents are those which bring the \" Auentyres of Arthure at the Tern Wathelyne,\" to a happy conclusion in the marriage of Sh Gawayne, and the retransforma tion of tho Foul Ladye, and the Grim Baron. This class, therefore, of Arthurian stories may be generahzed, and distinguished as the Comedy of the Table Eounde, or the Marriage of Sh Gawayne. Next in order may come that great class of adventures connected with the \" atehieving of the San Greal,\" and contained hi those romances which form a variously told epic, in which the chivalrous and religious spirit of the Crusades had its most popular cotem porary poetic expression. This third part of the stories of the \"Great Geste of Arthur\" may, then, be distinguished as the History of the Quest of the Holy Grail, or the Wars of Sir Perceval ; for he is ever the chief of the knights who achieve the Quest. And under this class may be also conveniently included those earlier legends of the foreign victories of Arthur, of which the adventures of the Quest afterwards took the place. Then, as the fourth part of the '\u25a0 Great Geste,\" we have the tragic stories of the discovery of the long unfaithfulness of the wife, and of the friend, and the news of the treason of the bastard son ; the death of the noblo, and beloved Sir Gawayne, the wound given him by Sir Lancelot fatally re-opened in"], [137, "S. (II.).] 119 THE NEW HELLAS. the first battle against the revolted Mordred ; the stiU more tragic scenes of the loveworn end of Merlin, and of the prophecies from his mystic tomb ; the last parting, and soon thereafter the death of Guenivere, and of \"the truest louer of a synfuU man that euer loued woman ; the kyndest man that ever stroke wyth swerde ; the goodelyest persone that euer came among prees of knyghtes ; the mekest mfin and the gentyllest that euer ete in halle among ladyes ; and the sternest knyghte to his mortall soo that euer put spere in the reyst ; \" 6 and, finaUy, the terrible mutual slaughter of the battle by the Western Sea, \" with the dolourous deth, and departyng out of thys worlde of them al.\" But not thus ends this wondrous Cycle of Eo mance. Succeeding those which may be distinguished as belonging to \" the Tragedy of the Morte d' Arthur, or the Eevolt of Mordred,\" we find a class of tales which not only give to the varied and tragic story of the \" Great Geste \" a high artistic repose and satisfaction, but a sort of infinite atmosphere. Such are the tales ofthe sore- wounded Arthur being borne away over the waves by the Ladies of Avalon to their Blessed Island in the West. And this class may be generaUy designated \"The Vision of Avalon, or the Departing into Light.\" Now what I would here point out is that the chief characters of the legends and romantic tales of aU these six different classes are connected with the North ; that not only are local habitations to be found in Arthurian Scotland for the chief incidents of these romances and traditions ; but that these Scotish localities are all in the most natural relation to each other ; in just such relation, indeed, as, had the Great Geste of Arthur been actually played out in Scotland, instead of being merely a Medi\u00e6val cycle of romantic adventures, the localities of its incidents would most probably have borne to each other ; and hence, that these Eomances must have had, as their bases, historical characters, adventures, and conflicts of Pre medi\u00e6val Scotland. 5 Malory, The Byrth, Lys, and Actes of Kyng Arthur, y. II. pp. 453-4. (Edit. Southey)."], [138, "120 [Ch. V. ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. First, then, as to the persons of the Arthurian Eomance-Cycle. To Scotland alone, so far as I am aware, belong distinct traditions, \u2014 either stiU living, as they for the most part are, or preserved in legendary histories, \u2014 not only of Arthur, but of Guenivere, of Lance lot, and of Mordred ; of Loth, the brother-in-law of Arthur, and of his nephew Gawayne ; of the Foul Ladye, and the Grim Baron ; of Perceval, the hero of the Quest of the Holy Grail ; and, above all, of Merlin the Wild, his twin-sister Ganieda, and his hfe-long love, Viviana, the divine Lady of the Lake. And in saying this, I but state one of the results of which the proofs have already been given in the account of my exploration of Arthurian Scotland. Then, as to the localities of the incidents of these Eomances, ob serve, first, that of all the places with traditions attached to them of the enchanted sleep of .Arthur and his Knights, there seems to be none that can, either in scenic, or traditional importance, vie with those Eddon Hills which form the fit centre of Arthurian Scotland. Then, as the appropriately romantic scene of the first part ofthe Great Geste we have the Merlin-haunted Caledonian Forest; Arthur's Seat, Arthur's Lee, and Arthur's Fountain ; the Queen of Scotish Lakes, Loch Lomond, or the Lake of Elms, in an island of which may well be feigned to have arisen the enchanted Garden of Joy ; the twelve great battlefields of the Freedom-War, ending with that of Bowden Hdl ; and the scenically unsurpassed Arthurian Castles of Edinburgh, Stirhng, and Dumbarton. Then, as the fit scene of the Comedy, we have the Kingdom of Logres, with Joyeuse Garde, the Castle of Seven Shields, Cardueil, Inglewood Forest, Castle Hewen, the Tarn Wathelyne, the Green Chapel, and the other localities I have noted on the English Border. The scenes of the Quest of the Holy Grail, as of the continental conquests of Arthur, forming the third part of the Great Geste, are, of course, beyond the limits of Arthurian Scotland. For, where these soenes are not kid in a wholly unidenti fiable region, corresponding to their supernatural character, they are"], [139, "S. (in).] 121 THE NEW HELLAS. generally in the sacred East, where is \" the citie of Crist our the salt flude.\" But, with the fourth part of the Geste, we may again return to Scotland, and find fit traditional localities for the tragic incidents of the Morte d' Arthur, in the Chatel OrgueiUeux ; Joyeuse Garde, become again Dolorous Garde ; Wedale, or the Vale of Woe ; the Tomb and perennial Thorn of Merlin, where the Stream of Wdlows joins the Tweed in the midst of his beloved Caledonian Forest ; the solitary northern Grave of Guenivere ; and the sunset battle-plain of Arderydd. FinaUy, over the Solway, as the Great Western Lake adjoining the last fatal battle-field, may fitly rise for us the Vision of Avalon. \u2022^ section (hi) The Geological Belations of Arthurian Scotland. Such is the completeness and unity of the Arthurian Topography of of Scotland, in reference to aU the chief characters, and all the various classes of tales comprised in the Arthurian Eomance-cycle. But not less distinctly marked, and complete in itself, is the region distin guished by this topography, both in a geological, and scenic point of view. For this Scotish district of Arthurian localities corresponds, with very singular accuracy, with two out of the four great geological divisions of the country. The first two of these are the Highlands, east and west of the Glen-more-nan-albin, the Great Glen of Albion, through which is cut the Caledonian Canal. This Highland region is separated from the rest of the country by what was anciently caUed the Mounth ; the chain of the Grampians running from south west to north-east, from Ben Nevis (4406 feet) to the Girdleness, the southern promontory of the Bay of Aberdeen ; and having, as its central domes, Ben-muich-dhui (4300 ft.), and the surrounding Cairn gorm Mountains, aU averaging upwards of 4000 ft. It is chiefly, if not exclusively along, or within this line, prolonged to the Mull of Cantyre, that are found the localities of Fingalian Tradition. Cnt-"], [140, "122 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. [Ch. V. ting this mountain-chain at right angles, and forming the great wind- and water-shear which separates the waters flowing into the western sea from those ruiming eastwards, is the other great moun tain range of the Highlands, called, in Latin, Dorsum Britanni\u0153 and Dor si Montes Britannici, and, in Gaelic, Drum-alban, \u2014 Drum being the equivalent of the Latin Dorsum. It takes its rise north of the isthmus, separating the Firths of Forth and Clyde, in the mountains of which Ben Lomond is the chief ; is broken by the great moor of Eannoch, but intersects the Mounth or Grampians at Ben Alder; crosses the Great Glen of Scotland at Achendrum, \" the field of the Drum,\" and finally loses itself in the mountains of Sutherland.6 The two other geological divisions of Scotland are the Midland Valley (vaUey, however, only in a geological sense) and the Southern Uplands ; the latter separated from the former by a line curiously parallel with that of the Grampians, running, like it, from south west to. north-east ; from Girvan in Ayrshire, to Dunbar in Had dingtonshho. It is these two southern geological divisions that form, with the adjoining English border, what, characterizing it by its traditional topography, I would call Arthurian Scotland. Thus do we see the vast secular changes of geology connected with, and determining such phenomena of a day as those which be long to human ages. Through millions of years worked the slow forces of which the outcome were the present geological divisions of Scotland. And these, at length, determined the seats of two famdies of a race of men, and the localities of their distinctive traditions. The general scenery of these two great northern and southern divisions of Scotland is strikingly dissimdar. And yet, in this dif ference, there is an interesting similarity to the contrasted cha racteristics of the different but alhed cycles of tradition and romance, Fingalian and Arthurian, of which the northern and southern districts respectively are the seats. Beyond the line of 6 Compare Skene, Chronicles ofthe Picts and Scots, pp. h\u0153riii.-iv."], [141, "S. (m).] 123 THE NEW HELLAS. the Grampians \" a sea of mountains rolls away to Cape Wrath in wave after wave of gneiss, schist, quartz rock, granite, and other crystaUine masses.\"' And the Fingalian legends seem fuU of the sentiment that the rocks and caverns resounding with the Atlantic waves, \u2014 that the deep glens, and the dark mountain-lochs, \u2014 that the fleeing and pursuing shadows of the clouds on the mountain-sides, \u2014 and that, above aU, the intermingling of the feminine grace and tenderness of the birch with the stately grandeur of the pine, \u2014 the intermingling of the bright and joyous music of the flashing, heather-purpling sunbeams, with the sterner, wilder voices of the storm-swept hdls, would appear well-fitted to create in an imagina tive and noble race. Very different is the scenery of the southern division with the broad belt of Lower Old Eed Sandstone at the base of the Gram pians, the igneous rocks, and carboniferous strata of the Midland district ; and the hard greywacke, shale, and limestone bands of the Silurian Uplands. Broad Firths, \u2014 Tay, Forth, and Clyde ; wide, fertile plains, such as that of Strathmore between the Grampians, and the low, seaward range of the Ochds, and the Sidlaws ; and abrupt, isolated crags and hdls, form the chief physical features of the former district ; whde the latter presents us with many foun tained, green-rolling, pastoral hdls, breaking down into river-lighted dales, famous in story and in song. To these succeed the wdd moor lands, the rich vales, and ancient forest-lands of the English border. Such, generally described, is the scenery of Arthurian Scot land. And in its more romantic, and varied, but less grand, and awe-inspiring character, it contrasts no less strongly with Scotland beyond the Grampians ; than do the elaborate and worldly Arthu rian Eomances that find in it the fit localities of their incidents, with the primitive Fingalian traditions recaUed by so many a mountain, cave, and glen, in the more northern, and wdder region. 7 Geikie, Geology and Scenery of Scotland, p. 91."], [142, "124 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. [Ch. V. To conclude, it is not merely to the antiquary, I venture to think, that this discussion of the origin of Arthurian localities, deter mination of their chief country, and indication of their Fingalian relations, may be of interest. For the new conceptions of the world, and of human history, and destiny, that science is forcing upon us, require a New Poesy for their synthetic expression; a new poesy to show that hfe, so far from being stripped, by the discoveries of science, of aU that makes it, to the nobler sort, worth having, is, on the contrary, by the progress of scientific knowledge, invested with a new beauty, a more tragic grandeur, and inspired with a deeper sense of the environing Infinite. New conceptions require new forms for their poetic expression. And as the Italian novels of the Eenaissance were a mine of poetic forms for our Elizabethan dramatists ; or as, to take a more appropriate ex ample, the old Greek legends, made an Iliad and an Odyssey of by Homer, furnished the poets of the great age of Greece with the forms of their immortal dramas ; so, I beheve, wiU the Pre-medi\u00e6val Celtic legends, as they have been prepared for us by the poetic ro mancers of the Medi\u00e6val Age, be found to present the most varied and easily adaptable material for the European poets who wdl dare un reservedly to accept Science.

Proofs of the foregoing Essay having been forwarded by Mr. FurnivaU to Mr. Pearson, the learned author of the History of England in the Early and Middle Ages, a discussion took place be tween him and myself, at the close of which I requested him to give me a memorandum of the chief points in his case, in order that the question as to the Historical Origin of Arthurian Localities generally, and as to the locality of Arthur's exploits in particular, might be presented with the utmost possible fairness and complete ness to those who might be interested in the subject. This he has very courteously, and obligingly done. And my readers wdl thus have an opportunity of judging for themselves whether the estab lished theory, which could not, I believe, have any more able and learned defender than Mr. Pearson, or the new theory, advocated by Mr. Skene and myself, rests on the better evidence. But before presenting his note, I would offer a few remarks on its general bearing in reference to the theory in the foregoing Essay maintained. And in the first place, I would observe that his argu ment touches only a smaU part of that general theory. For I have endeavoured to show not merely that, of the three regions of the traditional Arthur-land\u2014 Southern Scotland, Western England, and North-Western France\u2014 the historical Arthur, or the Arthur of Nennius, belonged to the first-mentioned ; but also, that, of a large proportion, at least, of the ancient historical poems of the Cymry,"], [150, "132 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. the scenery and events belong to Southern Scotland, with which likewise are connected the warriors celebrated in these poems, and the bards who sing their praises ; further, not only that personages, more or less directly and intimately connected with the .Arthurian story, such, for instance, as Merlin and Kentigern, historicaUy belong to the South of Scotland, and to the Arthurian Age; but that all the chief characters of the Arthurian Romances are to be found, in a topographically preserved and stiU living tradition, in what I have called Arthurian Scotland, and, as far as I am aware, in that region alone ; and finally, that these topographical records and traditional tales are in the most striking accordance with historical facts. Now, whatever objections may be urged by Mr. Pearson or others against a theory which places Arthur as an historical personage in the North, I have but tittle fear that any competent scholar wdl be found prepared to deny that these ancient Cymric poems do for the most part belong to Arthurian Scotland ; that to the same region the historical Merlin belonged ; that there also are to be found a greater number and variety of Arthurian traditions than in any other region of tbe Old Arthur-land ; and that such traditions have there more remarkable historical correspondences than are anywhere else to be discovered. But if such facts as these cannot be denied ; then, I think, that what appears to be the legitimate inference from them must be accepted ; \u2014 namely, that it was in actual characters, incidents, and conflicts of the Pre-medi\u00e6val History of Scotland that the traditions, topographicaUy preserved in Arthurian Locali ties, originated; and that in such actual characters, incidents, and conflicts, the historic element of the Arthurian Eomances of Medi\u00e6val Europoan Literature is to be found. This, however, is all that I am concerned to maintain. But let us see what Mr. Peiirson can say in favour of the hypothesis that Arthur was not a leader of the Cymry of Southern Scotland, but a petty king of Western England."], [151, "mr. Pearson's theory. 133 Most singular, I wdl only remark, it would be if, in conjunction with such facts as the above, such an hypothesis should force itself upon us. \" There seem to me to be fairly good reasons for referring Arthur to a district in the South or West of England, in spite of the fact that Scotland is distinctly richer in Arthurian localities. The one historical event with which we can almost certainly connect his name is the battle of Mons Badonicus ; and this is referred by Gddas to the year 520, ' when we have reason to think that the West Saxons were beginning to press on the Britons of Somerset shire and Wiltshire, whereas the wars of Ida in the North with the Kymri of the Western Lowlands are ascribed to a later period (a.d. 547) by our earhest notices.2 The tradition commemorated in the Vita Gild\u00e6, that Arthur, King of Cornwall and Devonia, was at war with Melvas of Somersetshire, points to a district in the South ; and if Melvas be indeed the Maglocunus, or Maelgoun of Gwynedd, whom Gddas speaks of as making war on his uncle, contracting an un lawful marriage, and turning monk, his resemblance to the Lancelot of romance becomes very great.3 After Gddas our first authority for Arthur's history is Nennius. Now the English Nennius (who was certainly not ignorant of Cumbrian history, as he gives us most valuable detads about Ida and Urien), says, if we take his words literally, that Arthur led the kings of the Britons in their wars against the kings of the Cantii.4 It is true that the passage may be explained to mean that he led them against the Saxons ; but even if we adopt this rendering, it is surely more natural to apply the term \"Saxons\" to the people strictly so called at the time when Nennius wrote (West Saxons, South Saxons, etc.), than to 1 Wendoveh, I. p. 64.

I haye not taken into account the marginal note to one obser vation of Nennius, which places Bregnion, the scene of one of Arthur's battles in Somersetshire, or the marginal gloss on Gildas, which says that Mount Badon W9s near tbe mouth of the Severn. But they are at least evidence of concurrent traditions."], [152, "134 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. assume that it refers to a colony of their ancestors, seated for a time in Northumbria.5 Moreover, the death-song of Geraint connects that hero, who was of Dyvnaint or Devonia, with Arthur.6 These notices one and all, therefore, refer Arthur to a district in the South and \"West ; while none that I know of takes him into the North tdl the times of Geoffrey of Monmouth. 6 Mr. Glennie informs me, on Mr. Skene's authority, that the Cambridge MS. of Nennius reads \" Tune Arthur pugnabat contra illos, videlicet Saxones.\" The question, then, is whether or not \"Saxones\" can be referred to Angles north of the Humber, or to a Saxon colony that preceded the Angles in those parts. To myself the words of Nennius seem distinctly to imply that he was thinking of the South of England. Throughout the Historia Britonum he uses the word Saxons (taken alone) in its special sense, and calls the people against whom Dutigirn fought (c. 62) Angles, the people whom Ecgfrith ruled \" Saxones ambronum\" (c. 57), and Edwin's sub jects \" ambrones\" simply (c. 63). \" Ambrones\" I take to be a corrupt form of Bede's word \"Hymbronenses\" (H.E. IV. c. 17) Humbrians, and its use with \"Saxones\" seems to me to imply that Nennius did not like to speak of Northumbrians generally as Saxons without qualification. Gildas uses the name Saxons for the people who fought against Vortigem and Aurelius Ambrosius, but seems not to know the name Angles. Bede speaks more than once of \" Anglorum sive Saxonum\" as if they were convertible terms (H. E. I. c. 15, V. c. 9), and applies either name to the people of Kent (whom he knows more precisely as Jutes), and sometimes seems to speak of the Germanic conquerors of Britain generally as Angles. But he never, so far as I am aware, uses the term Saxons in speaking of Northumbrians, or as a general name like Angli. An exami nation of the Codex Diplomaticus has shown me two cases in which the term Angli is perhaps used generally for Englishmen before the reign of Alfred. Under Alfred and Edward the Elder, the term \" Anglo-Saxon\" seems to be that most favoured. Afterwards the use of \" Anglus\" prevails. But I know of no instance in any Anglo- Saxon charter or author in which the name Saxon is applied to Englishmen of the- North. It is true the practice of Keltic writers is not equally invariable. The Gododin poems twice designate the enemy against whom the British chiefs engaged, have fought, or are fighting, as Saxons ; and probably refer in both cases to the Germanic population of Northumbria. It is true, too, as Mr. Glennie has pointed out to me, that Nennius must have thought of Ochtha and Ebissa, the son or nephew of Hengest, who, he says (c. 33), occupied country up to the confines of the Picts, as Saxons in the strictest sense, iiut I do not think these exceptions can outweigh the general consent on the other side, or the indications derived from the language of Nennius, when he connects thc rise of the Saxons with Ochtha's emigration south waid, and the history of thc kingdom of Kent. I may add that, as far as I can discover, Nennius never applies the name \" Brittoncs\" to the Keltic peoples Nurth of Solway, in the fifth century. 0 Skene, Four Ancient Books, v. I. p. 267. I may add, that whether Llongborth be the Longport of Kent, thc Langport of Somersetshire, or merely a port on the coast, it seems to point to an attack by sea which might easily be made in South England, but not, I think, in Scotland. It is notiocable, too, that Geraint was a Devonian name. Aldelmi Opera, p. 83."], [153, "mr. Pearson's theory. 135 \" Looking now to mere probabilities, I find that Cornwall, Devon shire, and parts of Wiltshire and Somersetshire, maintained their independence till tho time of Ine.' I find that a principality com posed of Somersetshire and part of Wiltshire, of Gloucestershire and Worcestershire, of Hereford and Monmouth, defended by Selwood Forest, by the Cots wold Woods, by Wire Forest, and by the Somersetshire marshes, had its own dynasty of chiefs before the Eomans,8 and a metropolitan city for a native church at Caerleon in the sixth century.9 A sovereign of this country with a certain federal supremacy over Devonshire and Cornwall in the South, and Powys and Gwynedd in the North, would come into collision with the Saxons along the marshes of Wiltshire, and the line of the Severn, and with the people of South Wales (whether Gaelic or Kymric at that time) in Glamorganshire.10 In these districts may be found locahties that correspond pretty exactly to the names of Arthur's battles as given by Nennius.11 \" Take now the evidence of legend. In the Breton traditions coUected by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Arthur is born at Tintagel, crowned first in Stichester by Dubricius, Archbishop of Caerleon on Usk, and afterwards more solemnly at Caerleon, and dies in Corn wall, and is buried in the Isle of Avalon. Even the Metrical Boece, which transfers the battle of Camlan to the Humber, steadily represents Arthur as King of South Britain. Wilham of Malmesbury, whose Liber de Antiq. Glaston. Ecc. was written about the middle of the twelfth century, gives a legend from the gests of 7 Guest, On the Boundaries of the Welsh and English Races.

King Arthur, which does not exist in Geoffrey of Monmouth, and which speaks of him as holding court at \" Karliuni,\" and visiting Glastonbury. Wdliam also says that Arthur gave lands to Glaston bury, and was buried there with his wife between two pyramids.12 As the historian does not speak of the disinterment of Arthur's body, he probably wrote before it took place in 1166 ;13 and this is the more likely, as he was born in the preceding century. He is, therefore, independent evidence to a tradition slightly anterior to the search made, and probably anterior to the history of Geoffrey of Mon mouth, the last six books of which were not published before 1147- The search for Arthur's remains has been twice described by Giraldus Canbrensis, in the De Instructione Principum,13 and in the Speculum Ecclesi\u00e6.1* The latter and fuller account, which refers with some contempt to the \" fabulosi Britones,\" who made Morgan a fairy, is written with a minuteness which seems to me incompatible with wanton lying. Both narratives are posterior to Henry the Second's time, and therefore were not written to support his policy. Both dwell upon the fact that Guenever's hair crumbled into dust when it was exposed to the air. Clearly the Glastonbury monks could not have forged evidence of this kind. Thc most that can be said is that they may have fabricated the inscription found on the coffin. Even this would have been highly hazardous, as they could scarcely tell before -hand that an unopened tomb contained two bodies, one of them a woman's. \"Why, then, are Arthurian localities comparatively rare in the district where Arthur lived and reigned ? Simply, I think, because from its natural wealth, it was the object of incessant attack from the Saxons, and was conquered and partially peopled anew at an early period by a people who had no interest in perpetuating the memory of their old antagonist. It is easy to see how the story 12 Gale, iii. pp. 306, 307, 326. 13 Brompton, c. ii. 62. It is remarkable that Malmesbury dedicates his book to a Henry, Bishop of Lincoln, who cannot be identified, unless the title be a clerical error for Henry, Bishop of Winchester ; and that Giraldus speaks of the search as made by Henry, afterwards Bishop of Worcester, who does not appear on any extant list of Bishops. 14 De Jur. Prin., pp. 191-193. Speculum Ecclesi\u00e6, pp. 47-49."], [155, "mr. Pearson's theory. 137 of Arthur would be carried into Brittany by fugitives before Ine. It is more difficult, I admit, to explain how it travelled North. But it is possible that CadwaUon recruited Britons from Devonia in the long and prosperous wars which he waged against the Northumbrian kings. ' Those immense forces, which nothing could resist,' 16 were surely not drawn altogether from North Wales ; and it was a time of peace in the South, when it could well spare soldiers.\" The foregoing very learned note of Mr. Pearson's contains, I believe, aU that can be said in favour of Arthur as a West of England king. It wdl be found, however, that the supports of his theory are essen tiaUy but three in number \u2014 Gddas, Nennius, and the Medi\u00e6val writers. Let us examine the two first; the last we shad find it unnecessary speciaUy to consider. First, as to Gddas, we must distinguish between the History by Gddas, and the Life of Gddas. The former alone is Pre medi\u00e6val, and of an authority independent of those Medi\u00e6val legends, the truth of which we are seeking to investigate. Now the History gives us no certain indication whatever as to the site of the Mons Badoni cus of Arthur's twelfth battle. For the expression, \" qui prope Sabri num ostium habetur,\" is an interpolation of the Durham MS. of the thirteenth century. As to the Vita Sancti Gildce, as it is not older than the twelfth century, it must rank, as an authority, with Geoffroy of Monmouth, and the other Medi\u00e6val writers. And what credence we should give to them must depend on their accordance with the other earlier historic^ authority which we now proceed to examine. Secondly, then, as to Nennius, Mr. Pearson's argument is here twofold. In the first place he says that the illos against whom jArthur fought were the reges Cantiorum.16 And, secondly, that if we are to under stand Nennius as meaning that he fought against the Saxons, then it must have been in the south, because the Teutonic invaders were in the north caded Angles. As to the first argument, without pausing to remark that it would take Arthur from thc sonth-ioest of England, 15 Bede, Hist. Ecc. Lib. iii. c. 1. H Nennius, \u00a7 56, p. 47 (English Hist. Soe). 10"], [156, "138 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. where Mr. Pearson places him, to the south-east ; it appears enough to say that, the whole passage being read, the sentence about the reges Cantiorum is, or, to say the least, may be meant as merely parenthe tical ; whde the \" dlos, videlicet Saxones,\" of the Cambridge MS. seems to settle the matter. There remains, then, but the second argu ment, namely that \" Saxones \" is applied only to the Teutonic settlers of the south of England. But remark, first, that Nennius does apply this term to the northern invaders. For he says that the son and brother of Hengest, and their foUowers, certainly as much \"Saxones\" as Hengest himself and his foUowers, occupied the \"regiones qu\u00e6 sunt in aquilone ; juxta murum, qui vocatur Guaul.\"17 And this being so, remark, secondly, that Nennius could not consistently have called the northern invaders Angles or anything else but Saxons. Again, re mark, thirdly, how very naturaUy that parenthetical sentence about the reges Cantiorum comes in, if we understand Nennius to mean that Arthur's successes were against the northern Saxons. Hengest being dead, Octa, his son, came from the north to take his place in Kent; \"tune Arthur pugnabat, etc;\"18 then Arthur fought against the northern Saxons, and, their great leader having thus left them, the fortune of war turned in favour of the Cymry. But the main thing to be remarked here is, fourthly, that Nennius could not have called the Northern invaders Angles, because their first settlement in Ber nicia was considerably later than the time he is speaking of, namely in 547, under Ida. And, fifthly, this becomes still further clear when we find that the earlier Teutonic settlers in the North were FYisians, a tribe of Saxons, who could not have been referred to as Angles.19 Thus it seems clear that, to say the very least, there is as little in the history of Nennius as in that of Gddas which can be held to fix the locality of the historical Arthur in the south. But it wdl, I think, seem also clear that when two suoh scholars and critics as Mr. \" Nennius, J 38, p. 29 (English Hist. Soe.) \"* lya <, r)6j p 47- 19 Skene, Early Frisian Settlements in Scotland, and Simpson (Sir James) On the Catstane at Kirkliston, etc., in Proceedings of tlie Soe of Antiqs. of Scotland, v.IV."], [157, "mr. Pearson's theory. 139 Pearson and Mr. Skene can take diametrically opposite views as to the meaning of Nennius, who is really our only important authority, the question must, if it is to receive a definitive answer, be treated after some new method. \" If not Gddas,\" says Mr. Pearson, \"certainly Nennius may be understood as placing Arthur in the south ; in the south may be found localities with names more or less nearly corres ponding with those of his twelve battles ; and, though the Medi\u00e6val histories may have no authority by themselves, yet in confirmation of this view of the meaning of Nennius, they are certainly of weight.\" Mr. Skene, on the other hand, maintains not only that the historic Arthur is the Arthur of Nennius, in which, I suppose, Mr. Pearson would agree with him, but that Nennius places him in the North ; that in the North the sites of his battles may be identified; that the mythic Arthur is the Arthur of Geoffrey, the writers of the twelfth century, and their foUowers ; that his story was introduced from Bretagne by Ehys ap Tewdwr in 1077, when the scene of his exploits was removed to the South ; and hence, finally, that quota tions from the writers of the twelfth and subsequent centuries cannot be considered as having any logical bearing on the question. It is in reference to this state of the discussion, that the method I have foUowed in the foregoing Essay may, perhaps, be held to be no immaterial contribution to the settlement of the point in dispute. That method consisted, as wdl be remembered, first, in examining Cymric history for a deduction as to the birthland of Arthurian Tradition ; secondly, in verifying this deduction by shewing that the region thus indicated is the chief country of traditional Arthurian localities; and, thirdly, in investigating the relations of this topography. It may, indeed, be said with reference to what I have specified as conditions inimical to the importation of Ar thurian traditions into the North ; as direct indications of the North as the birthland of these traditions ; and as conditions favour able to the importation of such traditions, iDto the South \u2014 that"], [158, "140 ARTHURIAN LOCALITIES. our knowledge of the period is but limited. Such a reply, how ever, implicitly admits aU that I affirm, namely, that, as far as our present knowledge goes, Cymric history points to the North rather than to the South as the country of the historical Arthur. And whatever may be said in answer to this critical deduction, I venture to think that in the very great number of indisputably ancient tra ditional localities, and of, at least, highly probable historical, and poetical identifications here coUected, there wiU be found a body of facts of which the only satisfactory explanation must be found in some such theory as that in this Essay maintained. And I say this with the more confidence, as my general result as to Arthur would appear to be in accordance with that of my coUaborateur, Mr. Nash, with respect to Merlin. Mr. Nash shows that, in the Merlin of Eomance, three persons are confounded, and that the reaUy historical Merhn was a bard of the North, in the sixth century. So, I would suggest, as I have, indeed, already hinted [Ch. H. (S. in).], that in the Arthur of Eomance there are confounded more persons than one, though the aArthur to whom, as an actual historical character, the traditions of the great conquer ing king are ultimately to be traced, was simply a sixth-century Guledig, or Leader of the Northern Cymry. And thus, I should hope that even Mr. Pearson, and those who think with him, may find it possible to reconcde their particular theory as to Arthur with the acceptance of tbe more general theory which I have sought to establish with respect to the historical origin of Arthurian Localities. With whatever modifications that theory may be held, there wdl, I trust, be found reasons advanced in the foregoing Essay sufficient to support the general conclusion that the clues historical basis of the Medi\u00e6val Arthurian Eomances is revealed to us in the Pre medi\u00e6val history of that region which I have distinguished as Arthurian .Scotland. 20 J Y 69 STEPHEN AUSTIN, PRINTER, HERTFORD."], [159, "(jTInuucr Satittg, First Beport (by Mr FvrivicaU), March, 1869.

This of itself alone would make the Society's first year, 1868, a noteworthy one in the history of Chaucer criticism; but the Society's editors have also been able to settle, and show by simple marks, the extent of Chaucer's direct borrow ings, in his Knight's Tale, from Boccaccio's Teseide, and also to explain the meaning of two of our poet's terms \u2014 chilindre and poudre-marchant tart \u2014 not properly understood before.

Specimens have likewise been given of the substitutes for these Moveable Pro logues when they are moved.

Qd. in hand for the heavy print ers' bill \u2014 say \u00a3300 \u2014 that we must owe. I therefore ask Members for the immediate payment of their subscriptions for 1868 and 18G9, and call on them to use every effort to raise our list to 250 members, so that we may have at least \u00a3500 a year to work with. Members must see that the Society's work is telling, is producing worthy results; they must know, or may guess, what that work costs the doers of it; and they will not, I feel sure, refuse to take their share in the trouble needed for raising sufficient funds to carry on the Society's work at tho pace its editors are able to go. More money is now wanted, and I rely on our Members to supply it. Lastly, I ask for a volunteer in Loudon as Honorary Secre tary, to take the correspondence and accounts off my hands. I should also be very glad if any ono would offer to examine the theological treatises De Pcnilenfia, of which one may prove to bo the original of Chaucer's Persones Tale. F. J.

Still, looking beyond our pale, we rejoice notwithstanding. \" Mr. Ker has dug boldly and diligently into the vein which Robertson opened ; but the result, as compared with that of the first miner, is as the product of skilled machinery set against that of the vigorous unaided arm.

Fairy Nightcaps. \" Neither a single story nor a batch of tales in a single volume, but a box of six pretty little books of choice Action is Aunt Fanny's contribution to the new supply of literary toys for the next children's season. Imagine the delight of a little girl who, through the munificence of mamma or godmamma, finds herself possessor of Aunt Fanny's tastefully-decorated box. Conceive the exultation with which, on raising the lid, she discovers that it contains six whole and separate volumes, and then say, you grown-up folk, whose pockets are bursting with florins, whether you do not think that a few of your pieces of white money would be well laid out in purchasing such pleasure for the tiny damsels of your acquaintance, who like to be sent to bed with the fancies of a pleasant story-teller clothing their sleepy heads with nightcaps of dreamy contentment. The only objection we can make to the quality and fashion of Aunt Fanny's Nightcaps is, that some of their joyous notions are more calculated to keep infantile wearers awake all night than to dis pose them to slumber. As nightcaps for the daytime, however, they are, one and all, excellent.\"\u2014 Athen\u00e6um. North British Review. Published Quarterly.
